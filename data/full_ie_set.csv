30th September - 1st October 2010

Cape Town, South Africa

The International Conference on e-Government (ICEG 2010) is an opportunity for academics to share the latest thinking on e-Government research.   e-Government developmental trends, adoption, architecture, transformation, barriers, success factors and management are factors that have lead to an escalation of the level of research activity on the topic. This is not least because the rise in e-Government provision brings with it a greater interest in the study of e-Government, from both a practical and a theoretical point of view. As controversy rages around issues such as e-Voting and identity cards, so academics, practitioners  and service providers pick up the gauntlet of supporting or attacking these issues. Much time and money is being spent in considering the best way forward and in examining what has been done well and what lessons can be learnt when things go wrong. This conference aims to bring evidence of the research being undertaken across the globe to the attention of co-workers and the wider community for the purposes of helping practitioners find ways to put research into practice, and for researchers to gain an understanding of additional real-world problems.

 

The conference committee welcomes both academic and practitioner papers on a wide range of topics and a wide range of scholarly approaches including theoretical and empirical papers employing qualitative, quantitative and critical methods. Action research, case studies and research-in-progress are welcomed approaches. Poster submissions, proposals for roundtable discussions, practitioner contributions and product demonstrations based on the main themes are also invited.

 

Submission details are given below. Possible topics may include, but are not limited to:


Applications of e-Government including New ideas for improving Public Service access, convenience, delivery, effectiveness, efficiency, innovation, trust; Health; education; homeland security; Electronic payments; e-Tax administration; Public record archives; Electronic waste; National implementation of e-Government.

The Fourth International Conference on Emerging Security Information Systems and Technologies
Venice, Italy
18th 

SECURWARE 2010, The Fourth International Conference on Emerging Security Information Systems and Technologies, is an event covering related topics on theory and practice on security, cryptography, secure protocols, trust, privacy, confidentiality, vulnerability, intrusion detection and other areas related to low enforcement, security data mining, malware models, etc.

Security, defined for ensuring protected communication among terminals and user applications across public and private networks, is the core for guaranteeing confidentiality, privacy, and data protection. Security affects business and individuals, raises the business risk, and requires a corporate and individual culture. In the open business space offered by Internet, it is a need to improve defences against hackers, disgruntled employees, and commercial rivals. There is a required balance between the effort and resources spent on security versus security achievements. Some vulnerability can be addressed using the rule of 80:20, meaning 80% of the vulnerabilities can be addressed for 20% of the costs. Other technical aspects are related to the communication speed versus complex and time consuming cryptography/security mechanisms and protocols.

Digital Ecosystem is defined as an open decentralized information infrastructure where different networked agents, such as enterprises (especially SMEs), intermediate actors, public bodies and end users, cooperate and compete enabling the creation of new complex structures. In digital ecosystems, the actors, their products and services can be seen as different organisms and species that are able to evolve and adapt dynamically to changing market conditions.

Digital Ecosystems lie at the intersection between different disciplines and fields: industry, business, social sciences, biology, and cutting edge ICT and its application driven research. They are supported by several underlying technologies such as semantic web and ontology-based knowledge sharing, self-organizing intelligent agents, peer-to-peer overlay networks, web services-based information platforms, and recommender systems.

To enable safe digital ecosystem functioning, security and trust mechanisms become essential components across all the technological layers. The aim is to bring together multidisciplinary research that ranges from technical aspects to socio-economic models.

As a multi-track event, SECURWARE 2010 will serve as a forum for researchers from the academia and the industry, professionals, standard developers, policy makers and practitioners to exchange ideas. The topics could be on techniques and applications, best practices, awareness and experiences as well as future trends and needs (both in research and practices) related to all aspects of information security, security systems and technologies.

Service-oriented systems represent a new class of software systems, in
which software is being used and integrated as temporary services rather
than being 'physically' integrated and owned permanently by the software
user. Those services are loosely-coupled, autonomous software entities
owned by third parties and representing different functionality, which
can be combined to support dynamic business processes. Thereby, service-
oriented systems provide a more flexible approach to software develop-
ment, provisioning and maintenance, allowing addressing the dynamics of
a system's environment and continuously evolving requirements.

Service-oriented systems have attracted great interest from industry and
research communities worldwide. Service integrators, developers, and
providers are collaborating to address the various challenges in the
field.

PESOS 2010 is intended to provide a forum for presenting and discussing
a wide range of topics related to service-oriented systems. The aim of
PESOS is to bring together researchers from academia and industry, as

                                       Malta
                   http://www.multimodal-corpora.org

A ""Multimodal Corpus"" involves the recording, annotation and analysis of
several communication modalities such as speech, hand gesture, facial
expression, body posture, etc. As many research areas are moving from
focused but single modality research to fully-fledged multimodality
research, multimodal corpora are becoming a core research asset and an
opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange of ideas, concepts and data.

This workshop follows similar events held at LREC 00, 02, 04, 06, 08.
There is an increasing interest in multimodal communication and
multimodal corpora as visible by European Networks of Excellence and
integrated projects such as HUMAINE, SIMILAR, CHIL, AMI, CALLAS and
SSPNet. Furthermore, the success of recent conferences and workshops
dedicated to multimodal communication (ICMI-MLMI, IVA, Gesture, PIT,
Nordic Symposium on Multimodal Communication, Embodied Language
Processing) and the creation of the Journal of Multimodal User
Interfaces also testify to the growing interest in this area, and the
general need for data on multimodal behaviours.

The 2010 full-day workshop is planned to result in a significant
follow-up publication, similar to previous post-workshop publications
like the 2008 special issue of the Journal of Language Resources and
Evaluation and the 2009 state-of-the-art book published by Springer.


AIMS

In 2010, we are aiming for a wide cross-section of the field, with
contributions on collection efforts, coding, validation and analysis
methods, as well as actual tools and applications of multimodal corpora.
However, we want to put emphasis on the fact that there have been
significant advances in capture technology that make highly accurate
data available to the broader research community. Examples are the
tracking of face, gaze, hands, body and the recording of articulated
full-body motion using motion capture. These data are much more accurate
and complete than simple videos that are traditionally used in the field
and therefore, will have a lasting impact on multimodality research.
However, the richness of the signals and the complexity of the recording
process urgently call for an exchange of state-of-the-art information
regarding recording and coding practices, new visualization and coding
tools, advances in automatic coding and analyzing corpora.


TOPICS

This LREC 2010 workshop on multimodal corpora will feature a special
session on databases of motion capture, trackers, inertial sensors,
biometric devices and image processing. Other topics to be addressed
include, but are not limited to:

     * Multimodal corpus collection activities (e.g. direction-giving
dialogues, emotional behaviour, human-avatar interaction, human-robot
interaction, etc.) and descriptions of existing multimodal resources

     * Relations between modalities in natural (human) interaction and
in human-computer interaction

     * Multimodal interaction in specific scenarios, e.g. group
interaction in meetings

     * Coding schemes for the annotation of multimodal corpora

     * Evaluation and validation of multimodal annotations

     * Methods, tools, and best practices for the acquisition,
creation, management, access, distribution, and use of multimedia and
multimodal corpora

     * Interoperability between multimodal annotation tools (exchange
formats, conversion tools, standardization)

     * Collaborative coding

     * Metadata descriptions of multimodal corpora

     * Automatic annotation, based e.g. on motion capture or image
processing, and the integration with manual annotations

     * Corpus-based design of multimodal and multimedia systems, in
particular systems that involve human-like modalities either in input
(Virtual Reality, motion capture, etc.) and output (virtual characters)

     * Automated multimodal fusion and/or generation (e.g., coordinated
speech, gaze, gesture, facial expressions)

     * Machine learning applied to multimodal data

     * Multimodal dialogue modelling

Call for Papers

The First International Workshop on RESTful Design (WS-REST 2010)
 aims to provide a forum for discussion and dissemination of research on the 
emerging resource-oriented style of Web service design.

Background

Over the past few years, several discussions between advocates of the 
two major architectural styles for designing and implementing Web 
services (the RPC/ESB-oriented approach and the resource-oriented 
approach) have been mainly held outside of the research and academic 
community, within dedicated mailing lists, forums and practitioner 
communities. The RESTful approach to Web services has also received a 
significant amount of attention from industry as indicated by the 
numerous technical books being published on the topic.

This first edition of WS-REST, co-located with the WWW2010 conference, 
aims at providing an academic forum for discussing current emerging 
research topics centered around the application of REST, as well as 
advanced application scenarios for building large scale distributed systems.

In addition to presentations on novel applications of RESTful Web 
services technologies, the workshop program will also include 
discussions on the limits of the applicability of the REST architectural 
style, as well as recent advances in research that aim at tackling new 
problems that may require to extend the basic REST architectural style. 
The organizers are seeking novel and original, high quality paper 
submissions on research contributions focusing on the following topics:

     * Applications of the REST architectural style to novel domains
     * Design Patterns and Anti-Patterns for RESTful services
     * RESTful service composition
     * Inverted REST (REST for push events)
     * Integration of Pub/Sub with REST
     * Performance and QoS Evaluations of RESTful services
     * REST compliant transaction models
     * Mashups
     * Frameworks and toolkits for RESTful service implementations
     * Frameworks and toolkits for RESTful service consumption
     * Modeling RESTful services
     * Resource Design and Granularity
     * Evolution of RESTful services
     * Versioning and Extension of REST APIs
     * HTTP extensions and replacements
     * REST compliant protocols beyond HTTP
     * Multi-Protocol REST (REST architectures across protocols)

All workshop papers are peer-reviewed and accepted papers will be 
published as part of the ACM Digital Library. Two kinds of contributions 
are sought: short position papers (not to exceed 4 pages in ACM style 
format) describing particular challenges or experiences relevant to the 
scope of the workshop, and full research papers (not to exceed 8 pages 
in the ACM style format) describing novel solutions to relevant 
problems. Technology demonstrations are particularly welcome, and we 
encourage authors to focus on ""lessons learned"" rather than describing 
an implementation.

Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submit at the 
WS-REST 2010 EasyChair installation

ABOUT THE CONFERENCE

Distributed application technology has become a foundation of the information
society. New computing and communication technologies have brought up a
multitude of challenging application areas, including mobile computing,
inter-enterprise collaborations, ubiquitous services, service-oriented
architectures, autonomous and self-adapting systems, peer-to-peer systems,
just to name a few. New challenges include the need for novel abstractions
supporting the development, deployment, management and interoperability of
evolutionary and complex applications and services, such as those bridging the
physical/virtual worlds. Therefore, the linkage between applications,
platforms and users through multi-disciplinary user requirements (like
security, privacy, usability, efficiency, safety, semantic and pragmatic
interoperability of data and services, dependability, trust and
self-adaptivity) becomes of special interest. It is envisaged that future
complex applications will far exceed those of today in terms of these
requirements.

The DAIS conference series addresses all aspects of distributed applications,
including their design, implementation and operation, the supporting
middleware, appropriate software engineering methodologies and tools, as well
as experimental studies and practice reports. This time we welcome in
particular contributions on architectures, models, technologies and platforms
for large scale and complex distributed applications and services that are
related to the latest trends towards bridging the physical/virtual worlds
based on flexible and versatile service architectures and platforms.

DAIS'10 is the 10th event in a series of successful international conferences
which started in 1997. It will provide a forum for researchers, application
and platform service vendors and users, to review, discuss and learn about new
approaches, trends, concepts and experiences in the fields of distributed
computing.


CONFERENCE THEMES

DAIS'10 solicits high quality papers reporting research results and/or
experience reports. All papers must be original, unpublished, and not
submitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere.

DAIS'10 especially encourages submissions addressing the following topics:

Web 2.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Social Recommender Systems Workshop

( http://nortia.det.uvigo.es/SocialRS )

8-10 September 2010
Cardiff, Wales, UK


Scope

Recommender systems have been around for several years as tools that help the users discover items (web pages, multimedia contents, commercial products, etc) they may be interested in. The goal of this session is to discuss the opportunities and challenges that arise in the recommenders' area with the advent of the Web 2.0, since it should be possible to learn much from the users' networks of contacts, from the (unstructured) clouds of tags that may surround the items, etc.
We welcome papers describing ongoing research or experiments with recommender systems grounded on social networking, in such aspects as user profiles, item characterization, reasoning techniques about underlying metadata structures (ontologies, folksonomies and any others in between), recommendation strategies, etc.


Publication

Accepted papers will be published in the KES proceedings by Springer-Verlag in Lecture Notes in AI as part of the LNCS/LNAI series.


Submission

Just like for the main track of KES, papers must be submitted in electronic form using the PROSE software review system. For formatting, please refer to the Springer-Verlag web site, and follow the Instructions to LNCS Authors.

Papers are required in PDF format for review purposes. The maximum length is eight pages in Springer format.


Important dates

- Submission of papers: 15 March 2010
- Notification of acceptance: 15 April 2010
- Receipt of publication files: 1 May 2010
- Registration deadline: 8 May 2010

Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
Shanghai, China
29 November 2010 - 1st December 2010

Background

APLAS aims at stimulating programming language research by providing a forum for the presentation of latest results and the exchange of ideas in topics concerned with programming languages and systems. APLAS is based in Asia, but is an international forum that serves the worldwide programming language community.

APLAS is sponsored by the Asian Association for Foundation of Software (AAFS) founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with many researchers from Europe and the USA. The past APLAS symposiums were successfully held in Seoul ('09), Bangalore ('08), Singapore ('07), Sydney ('06), Tsukuba ('05), Taipei ('04) and Beijing ('03) after three informal workshops held in Shanghai ('02), Daejeon ('01) and Singapore ('00). Proceedings of the past symposiums were published in Springer-Verlag's LNCS 2895, 3302, 3780, 4279, 4807, 5356, and 5904.

The 2010 edition will be held at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China.
Topics

The symposium is devoted to both foundational and practical issues in programming languages and systems. Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

    * semantics, logics, foundational theory;
    * design of languages and foundational calculi;
    * type systems;
    * compilers, interpreters, abstract machines;
    * program derivation, analysis, transformation;
    * software security, safety, verification;
    * concurrency, constraints, domain-specific languages;
    * tools for programming, verification, implementation. 

APLAS 2010 is not limited to topics discussed in previous symposiums. Papers identifying future directions of programming and those addressing the rapid changes of the underlying computing platforms are especially welcome. Demonstration of systems and tools in the scope of APLAS are welcome to the System and Tool presentations category. Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic are welcome to consult with Program Chair prior to submission.
Submission Information

We solicit submissions in two categories:

Regular research papers, describing original research results, including tool development and case studies, from a perspective of scientific research. Regular research papers should not exceed 16 pages in the Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and figures. They should clearly identify what has been accomplished and why it is significant. Submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. In case of lack of space, proofs, experimental results, or any information supporting the technical results of the paper could be provided as Appendix or a link to a web page.

System and Tool presentations, describing systems or tools that support theory, program construction, reasoning, and/or program execution in the scope of APLAS. Unlike presentations of regular research papers, presentation of accepted papers in this category is expected to be centered around a demonstration. The paper and the demonstration should identify the novelties of the tools and use motivating examples. System and Tool presentations papers should not exceed 8 pages in the Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and figures. Submissions will be judged based on both the papers and the systems or tools as described in the papers. It is highly desirable that the tools are available on the web.

Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission web page at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aplas2010. Acceptable formats are PostScript or PDF, viewable by Ghostview or Acrobat Reader. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers must be written in English. The proceedings are planned to be published as a volume in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Accepted papers must be presented at the conference.

               FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS
    

Mathematical Knowledge Management is an innovative field at the
intersection of mathematics, computer science, library science, and
scientific publishing. Its development is driven, on the one hand, by
new technological possibilities which computer science, the Internet,
and intelligent knowledge processing offer, and, on the other hand, by
the increasing demand by engineers and scientists for new techniques to
help in producing, transmitting, consuming, and managing sophisticated
mathematical knowledge.

The conference is concerned with all aspects of mathematical knowledge
management. Topics covered include, but are not limited to:.

* Representations of mathematical knowledge
* Repositories of formalized mathematics
* Mathematical digital libraries
* Diagrammatic representations
* Multi-modal representations
* Mathematical OCR
* Mathematical search and retrieval
* Deduction systems
* Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems
* Authoring languages and tools
* MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards
* Web presentation of mathematics
* Data mining, discovery, theory exploration
* Computer algebra systems
* Collaboration tools for mathematics
* Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows

MKM 2010 welcomes research papers and workshop proposals with links to
the above topics. The conference proceedings will be published in the
Springer-Verlag series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI).

More information about the MKM conference series can be found at the MKM
Interest Group Webpage: http://www.mkm-ig.org/


Submission Categories
=====================

Papers may be submitted in one of three categories: full papers, short
papers or system descriptions.

Both full papers and system descriptions should not exceed 15 pages,
must be original and not be submitted for consideration elsewhere. Full
or system description papers that are accepted will be published in the
conference proceedings. A submission not accepted as a full paper or
system description will automatically be considered as a short paper.

Short papers are of a less formal nature. They are intended to provide a
forum for the presentation and discussion of works in progress or ideas
that are not (yet) in a suitable form for submission as a full or system
description paper. They may be up to 5 pages in LNCS style. Depending on
the number of short papers accepted, presentation may be as a short talk
or as a poster. It will be at the discretion of the programme committee
to decide whether individual short papers will be accepted for
presentation only or for presentation and publication in the conference
proceedings.

The development of working systems in the field of Mathematical
Knowledge Management is a major undertaking of significant value to our
community. Papers describing such systems, however, are particularly
difficult to compare to non-system development based research with
respect to criteria common in reviewing. For this reason, papers in the
system description category will be considered separately and an
evaluation of their special contribution with be taken into account in
the review process.


Review Process
==============

* Authors must submit an abstract by the abstract submission date.

* The full paper, of any of the three categories, should be received by
  the paper submission date.

* Authors will then be sent initial reviews of their submissions.

* Authors then have the option of, within one week, submitting a single
  response to the reviews, limited to 500 words, in which they can
  clarify any issues or anser any questions that the reviewers had about
  their submission. This response can be submitted only once and cannot
  thereafter be resubmitted or modified.

* Final reviews and acceptance rejection decisions will be sent to the
  authors by the final notification date.

Tuscany Suites & Casino, Las Vegas, USA
August 4-6, 2010	 
http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~iri2010/ 

The increasing volumes and dimensions of information have dramatic 
impact on effective decision-making. To remedy this situation, 
Information Reuse and Integration (IRI) seeks to maximize the reuse 
of information by creating simple, rich, and reusable knowledge 
representations and consequently explores strategies for integrating 
this knowledge into legacy systems. IRI plays a pivotal role in the 
capture, representation, maintenance, integration, validation, and 
extrapolation of information; and applies both information and 
knowledge for enhancing decision-making in various application 
domains. This conference explores three major tracks: information 
reuse, information integration, and reusable systems. Information 
reuse considers optimizing representation methodologies; information 
integration studies strategies for creatively applying models in 
novel domains; and reusable systems focus on ontological 
opportunities for deploying models and corresponding processes.

The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and 
practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present, 
discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world problems with 
real-world solutions. The conference feature contributed and 
invited papers. Theoretical and applied papers are both included. 
The conference program will include special sessions, open forum 
workshops, and keynote speeches. A forum will be conducted with 
the intent of bridging IRI and Systems of Systems and why the future 
of intelligent computing - including computing applications - will 
lie at the juxtaposition of these two topical areas. 

The conference includes, but is not limited to, the areas listed 
below: 
- Large Scale Data and System Integration
- Component-Based Design and Reuse
- Unifying Data Models (UML, XML, etc.) and Ontologies
- Database Integration
- Structured/Semi-structured Data

PAPER SUBMISSIONS
Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with proceedings.  All submissions should be appropriately
anonymized (i.e., papers should not contain author names or
affiliations, or obvious citations). Submissions are to be made to the
submission web site at http://www.insticc.org/Primoris.  

Two categories of papers can be submitted:

- Regular Paper. A regular paper presents a work where the research is
  completed or almost finished.  Authors of regular submitted papers
  will indicate at the time of submission whether they would like
  their paper to also be considered for publication as a position
  paper.

- Position Paper: A position paper presents results that are
  preliminary or that simply require few pages to describe. A position
  paper may be a short report and discussion of ideas, facts,
  situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research
  (bibliographic, experimental, theoretical, or other) focused on one
  of the conference topic areas. The acceptance of a position paper is
  restricted to the categories of ""short paper"" or ""poster"".

Submitted papers should be at most 13 pages in total (for regular
papers) and 8 pages in total (for position papers) including the
bibliography and well-marked appendices, using 11-point font and
reasonable margins on letter-size paper, and should be in
single-column format. Committee members are not required to read the
appendices, and so the paper should be intelligible without them.
Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without
consideration of their merits. Submissions must be received by the
deadline of February 26, 2010 (midnight Samoa time). Authors of
accepted papers/posters must guarantee that their papers/posters will
be presented at the conference. 

Accepted paper will have to be formatted according to the SECRYPT
format, which is described at
http://secrypt.icete.org/paper_formats.asp, and adhere to the page
limit of 10 pages (for full papers), 6 pages (for short papers), and 4
pages (for posters). Accepted papers/posters will be published in the
proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and on CD-ROM support.

A selection of regular papers will be considered for publication of an
extended version in an edited book that will be published by
Springer-Verlag in a CCIS Series.

Creating Speech and Text Language Data With Amazon's Mechanical Turk

Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) is an online labor market that allows
you to pay people small sums of money to do ""Human Intelligence Tasks""
or HITs. Tasks include labeling images, listening to short pieces of
audio, researching topics on the internet, and scrubbing database
records.

A number of recent papers have evaluated the effectiveness of using
Mechanical Turk to create annotated data for natural language
processing applications. The availability of Mechanical Turk for
creating annotated speech and text language data can fundamentally
change human language technology tasks. Open questions include:
- How can we ensure high quality annotations?
- What tools are available for obtaining complex annotations?
- What types of annotations and evaluations are possible when the cost
is dramatically reduced?

This work will explore uses of AMT in several ways:
- Shared task: What can you do with $100 and AMT? Participants will be
given a budget to spend on AMT and submit papers describing the
results of their experience.
- General papers: These papers will explore general issues with using
Mechanical Turk for language processing research.

PURPOSE
The International Symposium on Health Informatics and Bioinformatics, (HIBIT), now
in its fifth year (HIBIT'10), aims to bring together academicians, researchers and practitioners
who work in these popular and fulfilling areas and to create the much-needed synergy among
medical, biological and information technology sectors. HIBIT is one of the few international
conferences on this subject in the world; therefore international participation from all around
the world is anticipated. HIBIT provides a forum for discussion, exploration and development
of both theoretical and practical aspects of health informatics and bioinformatics and a chance
to network with others working and researching in this area.

OVERVIEW

Model Driven Engineering elevates models to first class artefacts of the 
software development process. To facilitate multi-user collaboration and 
enable version management and seamless evolution of models and 
metamodels, support for robust and performant model comparison and 
differencing mechanisms is essential. 

Previous research has demonstrated that mechanisms used for comparison 
and differencing of text-based artefacts (e.g. source code) are not 
sufficient for comparing models, as they are unaware of the structure 
and the semantics of the compared artefacts. 

To date, several model-specific model comparison approaches have been 
proposed, each demonstrating different characteristics and focusing on 
particular sub-problems. For instance, model comparison techniques have 
been adopted for software refactoring, for transformation testing, 
to support the coupled evolution of metamodel and models, or to analyse 
existing artefacts with respect to some criteria. However the consensus 
is that this research area is still young and more research is required 
in order to achieve the full potential of model comparison. 

The goal of the workshop is to gather together both researchers in the 
area of model comparison and differencing to report novel results, and 
especially adopters of existing approaches to present their experiences 
and provide insights on issues encountered when applying these 
approaches in practice. 



TOPICS

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 - Model comparison
 - Model differencing
 - Model versioning
 - Metamodel evolution and model co-evolution
 - Empirical results from applying model comparison in practice
 - Industrial use cases
 - Benchmarking

All submissions will be formally evaluated by three reviewers. Papers 
must be submitted as PDF and strictly adhere to the ACM SIG proceedings 
format. Papers must not exceed ten (10) pages in this format, including 
all text, references, appendices, and figures. Paper submissions will be 
made electronically via the workshop submission web page, using the 
EasyChair service. All submissions must be original work, and must not 
have been previously published, nor be under consideration for 
publication, elsewhere. At least one author of each accepted paper 
should register for the conference and participate in the workshop. 



PUBLICATION PLANS

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library in the 
International Conference Proceedings Series. Extended versions of the 
highest quality submissions will be advocated for inclusion in a special 
issue of a journal.

Privacy and anonymity are increasingly important in the online world. Corporations, governments, and other organizations are realizing and exploiting their power to track users and their behavior. Approaches to protecting individuals, groups, but also companies and governments from profiling and censorship include decentralization, encryption, distributed trust, and automated policy disclosure.

The 10th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium addresses the design and realization of such privacy services for the Internet and other data systems and communication networks by bringing together anonymity and privacy experts from around the world to discuss recent advances and new perspectives.

The symposium seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of privacy technologies, as well as experimental studies of fielded systems. We encourage submissions from other communities such as law and business that present their perspectives on technological issues. As in the past, proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Like last year, the symposium proceedings will be available at the event, rather than after it.

Suggested topics include but are not restricted to:

    * Anonymous communications and publishing systems
    * Attacks on privacy and privacy technologies
    * Censorship resistance
    * Data protection technologies
    * Deployment models for privacy infrastructures
    * Economics of privacy
    * Fielded systems and techniques for enhancing privacy in existing systems
    * Location privacy
    * Policy, law, and human rights relating to privacy
    * Privacy and anonymity in peer-to-peer architectures
    * Privacy and inference control in databases
    * Privacy-enhanced access control or authentication/certification
    * Privacy-friendly payment mechanisms for PETS and other services
    * Privacy in Ubiquitous Computing Environments
    * Privacy threat models
    * Privacy vulnerabilities and their impact on phishing and identity theft
    * Profiling and data mining
    * Pseudonyms, identity management, linkability, and reputation
    * Reliability, robustness and abuse prevention in privacy systems
    * Traffic analysis
    * Usability issues and user interfaces for PETs

Papers to be submitted to the PET Symposium must be at most 15 pages excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and at most 20 pages total. Submission of shorter papers is strongly encouraged whenever appropriate. Papers must conform to the Springer LNCS style (in which the text area per page is a little smaller than 5"" x 7 3/4""). Follow the ""Information for Authors"" link at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html. Papers not following these instructions risk being rejected without consideration of their merits.

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings.

Reviewers of submitted papers are not required to read the appendices and the paper should be intelligible without them. The paper should start with the title and an abstract. The introduction should give some background and summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Submitted papers must not be anonymized. Proceedings will be published by Springer and made available at the symposium.

By submitting a paper, you agree that if it is accepted, you will sign a paper distribution agreement allowing for publication, and also that an author of the paper will register for the symposium and present the paper there. Our current working agreement with Springer is that authors will retain copyright on their own works while assigning an exclusive 3-year distribution license to Springer. Authors may still post their papers on their own Web sites. See http://petsymposium.org/2009/2009-springer-form.pdf for the 2009 version of this agreement.

Paper submissions must be received by February 15, 2010, 11:59 UTC (7 pm EST). Details about the paper submission process will appear on the PETS web site. Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent to authors by April 10th, 2010 and authors will have the opportunity to revise their papers for the proceedings version due on May 5th, 2010.
HotPETs

As was done last year, part of the symposium will be devoted to HotPETs ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe hottest, most exciting research ideas still in a formative state presented in 10 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 20 minutes for discussion and feedback from the audience. Submissions need not be technical in nature; we welcome challenges from other fields whereby our audience may learn about real world needs that require new research and solutions. Our intent is to bring new questions, approaches, and problems to our privacy community for discussion, feedback, and consideration of new approaches based on the diverse expertise of our attendees.

Submissions to HotPETs may be in either a 1 to 4 page extended abstract format, or a full length paper format. We prefer extended abstract format, and all accepted full length submissions must be converted to extended abstract form prior to the camera ready deadline. Successful submissions will have their abstracts printed for hard copy distribution at the event. The abstracts will not be part of the PETS proceedings in order to ensure authors may subsequently publish the expanded work, either in a future PETS or elsewhere. HotPETs submissions are due April 24, 2010, 11:59 UTC (8 pm EDT); submission instructions will appear on the PETS web site.
Panels

We also invite proposals of up to 2 pages for panel discussions or other relevant presentations. In your proposal, (1) describe the nature of the presentation and why it is appropriate to the symposium, (2) suggest a duration for the presentation (ideally between 45 and 90 minutes), (3) give brief descriptions of the presenters, and (4) indicate which presenters have confirmed their availability for the presentation if it is scheduled. Submit your proposal in the same manner as a PET Symposium paper, by the same deadline. The program committee will consider presentation proposals along with other symposium events, and will respond by the paper decision date with an indication of its interest in scheduling the event. The proceedings will contain 1-page abstracts of the presentations that take place at the symposium. Each contact author for an accepted panel proposal must prepare and submit this abstract in the Springer LNCS style by the ""PETS camera-ready deadline for proceedings"" deadline date.",http://petsymposium.org/,,

E-mail: ih2010@ucalgary.ca

For many years, Information Hiding has captured the imagination of researchers. Digital watermarking and steganography protect information, conceal secrets or are used as core primitives in digital rights management schemes. Steganalysis and forensics pose important challenges to investigators; and privacy techniques try to hide relational information such as the actors' identities in anonymous communication systems. These and other topic share the notion that security is defined by the difficulty to make (or avoid) inference on certain properties of host data, which therefore has to be well understood and modeled.

Current research themes include: 
- Anonymity and privacy
- Covert/subliminal channels
- Digital rights management
- Fingerprinting and embedding codes
- Multimedia and document security
- Multimedia forensics and counter forensics
- Novel applications of information hiding
- Other data hiding domains (e.g. text, software, etc.)
- Security metrics for information hiding
- Steganography and steganalysis
- Theoretical aspects of information hiding and detection
- Watermarking (algorithms, security, attacks)


Continuing a successful series that brought together these closely linked research areas, the 12th edition of Information Hiding will be held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Interested parties are invited to submit novel papers on research and practice which are related to the above areas of interest. Claims about information hiding technology, such as robustness or steganographic security, must be backed by strong evidence in the paper (such as mathematical proofs, statistical modeling or extensive testing). Submissions must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Submissions should follow the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format and should be no more than 15 pages including the bibliography and well-marked appendices. Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings published by Springer in the LNCS series. Authors can submit their manuscripts on-line on the conference website where detailed instructions are provided. The submitted papers should be anonymized avoiding obvious references.

It is well-known that successfully researching, designing and building new
mobile, ad hoc, mesh and opportunistic networking systems and algorithms
requires access to large-scale data on human mobility, encounter, and
social network patterns. Unfortunately, the wireless and mobile research
communities lack such data, with typical human contact traces consisting of
less than 100 nodes. We believe that large-scale datasets are important,
not only in communication network design, but also for fundamental study in
other academic disciplines, e.g., epidemiology, urban planning, and social
science. Complex networks research has flourished since 1989 when the first
large Internet (and later WWW) datasets became available. To achieve
similar improvements in mobile networking and related fields, large-scale,
and ideally planet-scale, datasets must be collected and made available.

Following a successful introductory event at ACM MobiSys 2009, this year's
workshop will challenge the community to collect large-scale human mobility
traces. Our aim is to highlight the issues in collecting data on a planet-
wide scale, so that the community can help develop mechanisms to collect,
share and analyse such data.

Topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Motivating applications for large-scale human mobility data collection,
  especially from other disciplines, e.g., epidemiology, sociology
- Methods for collecting large-scale human mobility datasets
- New analyses and applications of large-scale human mobility datasets,
  e.g., human dynamics characterisation and modelling
- Planet-scale data collection infrastructures
- Testbed federation for planet-scale data collection
- Incentive models for encouraging users and businesses to collect and
  contribute data on a planet-wide scale
- Enabling security, privacy and anonymity for large-scale data collection
- Regulatory, legal and ethical issues in planet-wide data collection

Scope:

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is concerned with the structure of service provision and consumption and the infrastructure to support the interactions. The architecture is made of service suppliers and consumers, with suppliers advertising through registries or brokers for consumers to discover. The use of SOA has been motivated by many industries changing focus from product delivery to service-based delivery. The focus on service delivery has also been apparent in software, where networking has become faster, more reliable and more available through reduced cost. The approach to SOA in software enables business process integration that characterises business functions as services, and integrates dynamically across departments and organisations.

Loose coupling is one of the key architectural principles of SOA, and this enables services to maintain a relationship that minimises dependencies and only requires maintaining an awareness of each other. Loose coupling is an approach where integration interfaces are developed with minimal assumptions between the sending/receiving parties, thus reducing the risk that a change in one service will force a change in another service. The loose coupling of SOA enables service implementations to be inter-changed and modified. However, service composition and integration is dependent on service interface definitions and requires management of workflow definitions to minimise impact on composite services. In the SOA, fast paced changes could be caused by evolution of services (e.g. adding or removing functions from services), evolution of service providers, evolution of networks and evolution of userÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s requirements. Changes in these cases could affect the dependability of service composition and integration. A composite service could be lost if one of the bound services offering the requested functions is removed by the service provider, or one of the requested functions that was previously available is removed or replaced by a different function.

There are strong needs for improving dependability of service-oriented computing to make service-oriented systems more reliable, secure and robust for service provision and delivery. The First International Workshop on Dependable Service-Oriented Computing aims at collating efforts and main achievements that contribute to research and development of service-oriented systems. This workshop will address new issues in design and development of dependable service-oriented systems as well as new challenges in modelling and simulation of novel service-oriented architecture. The relevant topics include, but not limited to:

    * Dependable distributed systems
    * Security in Service-Oriented Computing
    * Trust evolution in large-scale systems
    * Dependable Cloud Computing
    * Dependable P2P Computing
    * Service Composition and Integration
    * Real-time systems
    * Service-Oriented P2P systems
    * Dependable Grid Services
    * Evolutionary Service-Oriented Architecture
    * Industrial Case Study

Call for Papers

The First International Workshop on RESTful Design (WS-REST 2010) aims 
to provide a forum for discussion and dissemination of research on the 
emerging resource-oriented style of Web service design.

Background

Over the past few years, several discussions between advocates of the 
two major architectural styles for designing and implementing Web 
services (the RPC/ESB-oriented approach and the resource-oriented 
approach) have been mainly held outside of the research and academic 
community, within dedicated mailing lists, forums and practitioner 
communities. The RESTful approach to Web services has also received a 
significant amount of attention from industry as indicated by the 
numerous technical books being published on the topic.

This first edition of WS-REST, co-located with the WWW2010 conference, 
aims at providing an academic forum for discussing current emerging 
research topics centered around the application of REST, as well as 
advanced application scenarios for building large scale distributed systems.

In addition to presentations on novel applications of RESTful Web 
services technologies, the workshop program will also include 
discussions on the limits of the applicability of the REST architectural 
style, as well as recent advances in research that aim at tackling new 
problems that may require to extend the basic REST architectural style. 
The organizers are seeking novel and original, high quality paper 
submissions on research contributions focusing on the following topics:

     * Applications of the REST architectural style to novel domains
     * Design Patterns and Anti-Patterns for RESTful services
     * RESTful service composition
     * Inverted REST (REST for push events)
     * Integration of Pub/Sub with REST
     * Performance and QoS Evaluations of RESTful services
     * REST compliant transaction models
     * Mashups
     * Frameworks and toolkits for RESTful service implementations
     * Frameworks and toolkits for RESTful service consumption
     * Modeling RESTful services
     * Resource Design and Granularity
     * Evolution of RESTful services
     * Versioning and Extension of REST APIs
     * HTTP extensions and replacements
     * REST compliant protocols beyond HTTP
     * Multi-Protocol REST (REST architectures across protocols)

All workshop papers are peer-reviewed and accepted papers will be 
published as part of the ACM Digital Library. Two kinds of contributions 
are sought: short position papers (not to exceed 4 pages in ACM style 
format) describing particular challenges or experiences relevant to the 
scope of the workshop, and full research papers (not to exceed 8 pages 
in the ACM style format) describing novel solutions to relevant 
problems. Technology demonstrations are particularly welcome, and we 
encourage authors to focus on ""lessons learned"" rather than describing 
an implementation.

Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submit at the 
WS-REST 2010 EasyChair installation

========================================================================

The CRIWG Conference on Collaboration and Technology seeks scientific papers
that inform the design, development, deployment, and use of collaboration
technology (groupware) and the work practices they support. Founded in 1995,
CRIWG has become a significant forum for researchers and professionals to
exchange ideas and experiences about problems and solutions related to
collaboration technology.

Most challenges in the collaboration technology field require a
multidisciplinary, multi-methodological approach. CRIWG seeks papers on
groupware from a wide variety of academic perspectives and epistemologies,
ranging from collaborative and exploratory research, to theory building and
testing, applied research, design science, engineering, and innovative
evaluation methods. Researchers can report their ideas, theories, models,
designs and experimental results to CRIWG either by submitting full paper
contributions, in case of mature works, and shorter papers reporting
innovative work in progress. As in previous years, the authors of the best
papers will be invited to submit extended versions to selected journals. PhD
students are invited to present their research in the doctoral colloquium.

The CRIWG conference is supported by the Collaboration Research
International Working Group, www.criwg.org (file://www.criwg.org) , an open
community of researchers. Traditionally, CRIWG is organized in remote places
alternating between the Americas and Europe, with a small number of
presentations, fostering critical discussion, team building and
collaboration. The location selected for the CRIWG 2010 conference is
Maastricht, the Netherlands. Delft University of Technology will organize
the conference.

PAPER SUBMISSION
----------------
We welcome submissions both from academia and the industry on any topic that is of interest to the NLP community, particularly encouraging research emphasizing multidisciplinary aspects of NLP and the interplay between linguistics, computer science and application domains such as biomedicine, communication systems, public services, and educational technology.

Submitted papers should describe original work, emphasizing completed or well advanced, rather than intended, research. The state of completion of the reported work must be clearly indicated. Where appropriate, results should be rigorously evaluated; the assessment of statistical significance for quantitative results is encouraged. Submissions should contain original material that has not been previously presented to the scientific community. A parallel submission to other publication fora as well as a significant overlap in contents with previously published work should be clearly indicated to the program committee.

All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. The submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, technical quality, and presentation. Papers can be submitted in two categories:

    * Full papers, describing substantial research with well-evaluated results
    * Short papers, typically describing ongoing research and preliminary results

At the conference, full papers will be presented as a talk and short papers will be presented as a poster. 

Further information regarding paper submission can be found at http://icetal.ru.is.


PROCEEDINGS
-----------
All accepted papers in both categories will be published in the conference proceedings. The proceedings will be published by Springer Publishers as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science/Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNCS/LNAI) series.

27,Linked Data on the Web (LDOW2010) Workshop at WWW2010,27/04/2010,27/04/2010,"Raleigh, North Carolina, USA",15/02/2010,08/03/2010,21/03/2010,"Linked Data on the Web (LDOW2010) Workshop at WWW2010

=========================================

April 27th, 2010, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA

=========================================

Objectives

The Web is increasingly understood as a global information space
consisting not just of linked documents, but also of linked data. More
than just a vision, the resulting Web of Data has been brought into
being by the maturing of the Semantic Web technology stack, and by the
publication of large datasets according to the principles of Linked
Data. To date, the Web of Data has grown to a size of roughly 13.1
billion RDF triples, with contributions coming increasingly from
companies, government and public sector projects, as well as from
individual Web enthusiasts. In addition to publishing and interlinking
datasets, there is intensive work on Linked Data browsers, Web of Data
search engines and other applications that consume Linked Data from
the Web.

LDOW2010 follows the successful LDOW2008 workshop at WWW2008 in
Beijing and the LDOW2009 workshop at WWW2009 in Madrid. As the
publication of Linked Data on the Web continues apace, the need
becomes more pressing for principled research in the areas of user
interfaces for the Web of Data as well as on issues of quality, trust
and provenance in Linked Data. We also expect to see a number of
submissions related to current areas of high Linked Data activity,
such as government transparency, life sciences and the media industry.
The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for exposing high
quality, novel research and applications in these (and related) areas.
In addition, by bringing together researchers in this field, we expect
the event to further shape the ongoing Linked Data research agenda.

=========================================

Topics of Interest

Topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to,
the following:

1. Linked Data Application Architectures
  * crawling, caching and querying Linked Data
  * dataset dynamics and synchronization
  * Linked Data mining

2. Data Linking and Data Fusion
  * linking algorithms and heuristics, identity resolution
  * Web data integration and data fusion
  * link maintanance
  * performance of linking infrastructures/algorithms on Web data

3. Quality, Trust and Provenance in Linked Data
  * tracking provenance and usage of Linked Data
  * evaluating quality and trustworthiness of Linked Data
  * profiling of Linked Data sources

4. User Interfaces for the Web of Data
  * approaches to visualizing and interacting with distributed Web data
  * Linked Data browsers and search engines

5. Data Publishing
  * tools for publishing large data sources as Linked Data on the Web
(e.g. relational databases, XML repositories)
  * embedding data into classic Web documents (e.g. RDFa, Microformats)
  * describing data on the Web (e.g. VoiD, Semantic Site Map)
  * licensing issues in Linked Data publishing

6. Business models for Linked Data publishing and consumption

=========================================

Submissions

We seek three kinds of submissions:

1. Full technical papers: up to 10 pages in ACM format
2. Short technical and position papers: up to 5 pages in ACM format
3. Demo description: up to 2 pages in ACM format

Submissions must be formatted using the WWW2010 templates available at
http://www2010.org/www/authors/submissions/formatting-guidelines/.

Submissions will be peer reviewed by three independent reviewers.
Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop and included in the

17th Symposium on the Integration of
Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning

*************************************
 )))) DEADLINE EXTENSION ((((

 Abstract submission: March 12, 2010
 Submission deadline: March 15, 2010
*************************************

Calculemus is a series of conferences dedicated to the integration of computer
algebra systems (CAS) and systems for mechanised reasoning, the interactive
theorem provers or proof assistants (PA) and the automated theorem provers
(ATP).

Currently, symbolic computation is divided into several (more or less)
independent branches: traditional ones (e.g., computer algebra and mechanised
reasoning) as well as newly emerging ones (on user interfaces, knowledge
management, theory exploration, etc.) The main concern of the Calculemus
community is to bring these developments together in order to facilitate the
theory, design, and implementation of integrated systems for computer
mathematics that will routinely be used by mathematicians, computer scientists
and engineers in their every day business.

We seek original research papers for the upcoming Calculemus meeting, which
will be held jointly with AISC 2010 and MKM 2010 (confederated in the
Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics, CICM 2010) in Paris (France).

Topics of Interest
==================

The scope of Calculemus covers all aspects of the interplay of mechanised
reasoning and computer algebra, including cross-fertilisation between those two
research areas, as well as the development of integrated systems that transcend
both computer algebra and theorem proving. Potential topics of interest
include:

  * Theorem proving in computer algebra (CAS)
  * Computer algebra in theorem proving (PA and ATP)
  * Case studies and applications that both involve computer algebra and
    mechanised reasoning
  * Representation of mathematics in computer algebra
  * Adding computational capabilities to PA and ATP
  * Formal methods requiring mixed computing and proving
  * Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction
  * Mathematical computation in PA and ATP
  * Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for computer
    mathematics
  * Infrastructure for mathematical services
  * Theory exploration techniques

Papers on other topics closely related to the above research areas will also be
welcomed for consideration.

Submission
==========

Theoretical and applied research papers on all topics within the scope of the
symposium are invited. Submitted papers must be in English and must not exceed
15 pages for full papers and we suggest 10 pages for emerging trends extended
abstracts (the upper limit is 20 pages, authors must provide at least a title
and 200 word abstract). The title page should contain the title, author(s) with
affiliation(s), e-mail address(es), listing of keywords and abstract. The
program committee will subject all full papers submitted to a peer review.
Emerging trends papers will be lightly reviewed. Results must be unpublished.

Papers should be prepared in LaTeX and formatted according to the requirements
of the Springer's LNAI series (the corresponding style files can be downloaded
from http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html and are the same for LNCS
and LNAI).

The web page for electronic submission is:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calculemus2010

Paris, September 28 - 30, 2010

The 40th European Microwave Conference (EuMC) that will be held in Paris, France, from September 28 - 30, is the core of European Microwave Week 2010, the largest event in Europe dedicated to microwave electronics.

The European Microwave Conference is the premier forum for presentation of the present status and future trends in the fi eld of microwave, millimetre- and submillimetre-wave systems and technologies. A broad range of high-frequency related topics, from materials and technologies to integrated circuits, systems and applications will be addressed in all their aspects: theory, simulation, design and measurement. Examples include the latest development for passive components, modelling and design of high frequency and high data-rate photonics, highly stable and noiseless microwave and millimetre-wave sources, new linearization and power generation techniques and the impact of new packaging technologies on development applications. Special emphasis will be placed on emerging technologies such as MEMS, meta-materials, reconfi gurable RF components and systems, communication receivers and transmitters. The scope also includes electromagnetic fi eld theory, numerical techniques, theoretical and experimental developments in wave propagation, remote sensing, antenna systems and advanced simulation techniques.

The EuMC is thus the perfect event to keep up to date with recent achievements in the RF, microwave and millimetre-wave domain. It provides many opportunities to network and interact with international experts in a wide variety of specialities, attracting delegates with academic and industrial backgrounds. With more than 300 selected papers in about 60 oral and poster sessions, the conference represents an exciting forum for the presentation and discussion of the most recent advances in the microwave arena.

Paris, September 27-28, 2010

The third European Wireless Technology (EuWiT) Conference will be held from September 27 - 28, 2010 in Paris, France, as part of the European Microwave Week.

The conference is the principal forum for the presentation of new developments in the fi eld of wireless techniques and technologies for communication, broadcasting, sensing, positioning and navigation applications. It covers the different aspects of technology for wireless systems: applications and standards, systems and signal processing, antenna and propagation, key architectures and sub-systems for base stations and mobile terminals.

EuWiT is a conference co-sponsored by EuMA and the IEEE MTT Society. It attracts international experts from academic and industrial backgrounds to discuss recent advances in the wireless technology arena.

Wireless Technology is a very dynamic fi eld of research and innovation. MIMO and OFDM techniques have emerged as enabling technologies for 4G communication systems. They have also generated new challenges in terms of transmitter architectures with good effi ciency and linearity, and in terms of the integration of MIMO transceiver and antennas in mobile user terminals. Smart everyday objects incorporating sensors, wireless communication and positioning devices, are supporting many new applications such as environment monitoring, machine-to-machine communications and body area networks. Their development is the subject of intensive research on topics such as autonomous communicant sensors, wireless cooperative systems, electromagnetic modelling of complex environments. Some other challenges are cognitive radio, millimetre wave mobile communications with low power consumption, modelling of non stationary channels for vehicular communications.

EuWiT is a unique interdisciplinary conference providing the opportunity for researchers and product developers from all over the world to update and share their knowledge. Authors are encouraged to submit high-quality papers describing original contributions in a wide range of topics in wireless communications. The conference is an integral part of the European Microwave Week. Along with the key areas of wireless activity, the microwave as well as the integrated circuit aspects of wireless technology will be emphasised. There will also be joint sessions with other European Microwave Conferences covering subject matters of mutual interest.

Conference:  20-23 October 2010

CONFERENCE SCOPE

FMCAD 2010 is the tenth in a series of conferences on the theory and
application of formal methods in hardware and system design and
verification.  FMCAD provides a leading international forum to researchers
and practitioners in academia and industry for presenting and discussing
novel methods, technologies, theoretical results, and tools for formally
reasoning about computing systems, as well as open challenges therein. This
year, FMCAD is privileged to have Joseph Sifakis, Founder and Director of
VERIMAG Laboratory, a Turing Award 2007 winner, to deliver its keynote
address on Scientific Challenges and Work Directions in Embedded Systems
Design.

NEW: FMCAD 2010 has two tracks (but no parallel sessions): the research
track and the industrial track.

RESEARCH TRACK

Topics of interest:

   Advancing industrial-strength technologies in Model Checking,
   Theorem Proving, Equivalence Checking, Abstraction and Refinement
   Techniques, Reduction and Abstraction Techniques, Compositional
   Methods, Decision Procedures, SMT solvers, Bit-Precise Reasoning,
   Word-Level Techniques, SAT- and BDD-based methods, Probabilistic
   Methods, and Combinations of Deductive Methods and Decision
   Procedures.

   Applications of Formal Methods in Specification, Design and
   Verification

   Topics relating to the application and applicability of Property-Based
   Verification, Equivalence Checking, Semi-formal Verification, Runtime
   Verification, Simulation and Test-case Generation, Coverage Analysis,
   Microcode Verification, Concurrent Systems, Timing Verification, and
   Formal Approaches to Performance and Power.

   System-Level Design and Verification, especially for Embedded
   Systems, Software Verification, HW/SW Co-Design and Verification,
   Transaction-Level Verification.

   Modeling and Specification Languages, Model-Based Design,
   Verification-Based Testing, Design Derivation and Transformation,
   Correct-by-Construction Methods.

INDUSTRIAL TRACK

   This track is dedicated to industry users of formal methods, including
   work on real industrial-scale designs being done in universities and
   research organizations. We invite such users to describe their experience with
   formal methods, including evaluations of commercial tools, case studies of
   industrial-scale applications, experience reports on novel and challenging
   applications, or methodologies for the incorporation of formal or semi-
   formal methods into the industrial design flow.  Finally, we invite tool
   presentations, of industrial-strength commercial tools as well as novel
   academic tools that are not yet industrial strength, but address a real
   industrial need.  Tool presentations should describe the capabilities or
   novel features of the tool, or an innovative algorithm, a new approach,
   or original application methodology.

   EXHIBITION 

   FMCAD 2010 will feature also an exhibition with limited free-of-charge
   booth space for which academic novelty is not a requirement.  Note that 
   since space is limited, we will not be able to accept every request for a booth, 
   and that preference will be given to requests by authors of accepted tool 
   presentations.  EDA vendors are especially encouraged to submit a tool 
   presentation and/or to request booth space in order to demo their tools.

SUBMISSIONS

   Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair.
   More details will be provided on the FMCAD web site.  The
   proceedings are planned to be published by IEEE and ACM and will be
   available online in the ACM Digital Library and at IEEE Xplore.

   Research Track Submissions

   Two categories of research papers can be submitted: regular papers (8
   pages) containing original research, and short papers (4 pages) describing
   emerging results and work-in-progress.

   Industrial Track Submissions

   Submitters to the industrial track will have the option of submitting a
   regular paper (8 pages), a short paper (4 pages), or a deck of up to
   25 slides (for tool presentations: 4 pages or 15 slides). Both papers
   and slide submissions will be reviewed. Regular and short papers will
   appear in the proceedings as usual, while authors of accepted slide 
   presentations will be invited to write a one page abstract for the 
   proceedings.

   For exhibition space, submission is not required and an email request to
   the industrial track chairs is sufficient.  However, due to limited space
   we will not be able to accept every request.  We therefore strongly
   advise those interested in exhibition space to submit a tool presentation, 
   as we will give preference for booth space to authors of accepted tool 
   presentations.

   Regular and short papers must use the IEEE Transactions format on
   letter-size paper using a 10-point font (see
   www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html).
   Research Track papers must contain original research that has not been
   previously published, nor concurrently submitted for publication.  For
   both research and industry submissions, any partial overlap with a
   published or concurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated.
   (For slide decks, use an extra slide to discuss overlaps; this slide may
   be excluded from the final presentation.)  By submitting their work,
   the authors agree to present it at the conference if selected. Authors
   are strongly encouraged to provide adequate access to their
   experimental data for verification.

   A small number of accepted papers will be considered for a
   distinguished paper award.

Call for Papers

Large-scale  networks   with  complex  interaction  patterns   between
elements are found in abundance in Communication Networks like: social
networks, blog & collaborative  networks, WWW, P2P, DTN, Sensors... In
the last decade many research efforts  contributed to establishing the
concept  of a network  science   to characterize,  model,  and analyze
complex networks. Network Science founds applications  in a variety of
domains  and   show a  mainstream   research  topic  of  interest  for
theoretical physicists,  epidemiologists,   biologist, economists, and
computer scientists.

For the communication networking community  there is a strong research
interest in the analysis  of the structure  and properties  of dynamic
networks  at several layers: network/communication  layers but also at
the  social/application  layers. Understanding  how the  interplay  of
these different layers of complex  networks happens and the  potential
mutual effects they may have on each other  in a dynamic graph context
is a key challenge.


Topics
- Bio-inspired networks
- Correlation of different types of social networks
- Delay tolerant and disruption tolerant networks (DTN)
- Discrete optimization and algorithms
- Dynamical processes (proliferation, diffusion etc.)
- Game theoretic models, pricing and incentives on dynamic networks
- Implications of social networking on distributed network/systems
- Mobility modeling and management
- Robustness & Stability of dynamical networks
- Sensor Networks
- Social networks
- Characterizing and analyzing dynamic networks
- Tools and methods   for collecting, analyzing, or  visualizing  data

This ACL 2010 Workshop July 15, 2010

 

In this workshop we want to explore promising new methods to design and evaluate dialogue systems able to act as Companions, as well as to report and review recent advances in a wide range of Companion-related topics. The workshop also aims at being a forum for focussed discussion of what it is to give a convincing and useful illusion of ""personality"" in a long-term Companion, when that is advantageous and when not and, above all, what is the precise role of language and speech technology in achieving this.

 

We solicit papers on topics related to the overall notion of companionableness in dialogue systems as defined above, with the emphasis on the Human Language Technology aspects of their function. We seek contributions that deal with issues such as:

 

* Augmentation of speech recognizers and synthesizers for the detection and provision of emotion, affect and attitude in speech input and output.

* Integration of speech and NLP methods for the extraction of content in companionable systems

* Dialogue management systems that support realistic guidance of dialogue by attitude, empathy, emotion etc.

* Methods and approaches to learn realistic dialogue managers

* Representation and reasoning to support such companionable systems (forms of predicate logic, NL, RDF)

* Applications of companionable dialogue systems for domains such as health, learning, security, care of the vulnerable and lonely etc.

* Novel methods for evaluating (companionable) dialogue systems.

* integration of vision and other non-verbal sensors in dialogue understanding.

*Use of non-verbal behavior of avatars and physical effectors  to express dialogue and affective content.

 

We also look for more theoretical contributions that address questions such as:

 

* How much and what kind of personality do users want in companionable dialogue systems?

* Are there genuinely new advances in machine learning applicable to dialogue?

* What are the social and ethical consequences of the appearance and deployment of such systems?

* Is there a real tension between task-based approaches and other paradigms?

* Is emotion core or peripheral to such companionable dialogue systems?

* Can IE methods be successfully deployed in the extraction of content in dialogue?

* Have chatbots anything to teach us in the goal of creating companionable systems?

* What is the best metaphor for describing such systems: companions, confidants, intelligent dialogue buddies, guides, escorts, assistants, colleagues?

* Does NL yield the most ""affordances"" for such companionable systems, as opposed to multi-modal methods?

* How far can such systems offer real company, real relationships in the future?

* How much are politeness and emotion matters of NLP and computational linguistics, rather than some separate discipline or area?

* The perennial problem of the provision of dialogue data and how much is needed for effective machine learning?

* How close are such systems to embodiment in mobile applications?

* Could a Companion be a collective or agency of  entities, with separate personalities between which a user could choose?

* Need a dialogue Companion be a full conversational participant or sometimes just a ""foil"" or ""echo"", who does not carry the whole conversation entities (thus raising issues of multi-party dialogue acts)?

 

 

Motivation

The current state of dialogue technology has come a long way since the abstract ideas of intelligent computer systems in the beginning of 1950s: dialogue technology now provides interactive service agents, while research explores various aspects of multimodal and multiparty communication so as to improve natural and social aspects of dialogue systems. In this workshop, interest is focussed especially on dialogue systems able to act as Companions, i.e. software agents with advanced human language technology capacities, able to display and recognise emotion and aspects of personality as well as to interact with a user, possibly over a long period, learning about their needs and interests, performing services, entertaining, consoling, and so on. Our focus will be on text and speech aspects of dialogue with Companions, but we shall also be open to discussion of the impact of  non-dialogue phenomena (e.g. presence, low-level control and recognition, avatar technology etc.) on dialogue and the interaction of other modalities with dialogue.

 

Dialogue technology has two main historical sources, both still of relevance today: first, the chatbot tradition going back at least to ELIZA and PARRY and, secondly, the task-driven knowledge-based system back to at least BASEBALL and SHRDLU, all these examples being from the late 1960s. The great chatbots of the past, which bear little relationship to the current rash of Internet products, did have some claim to companionableness of a sort, and e.g. PARRY had explicit emotion parameters of fear and anger that affected its outputs. The chatbots sometimes left initiative with the user (like ELIZA which initiated nothing) and sometimes with the system (like PARRY, who had long paranoid stories to tell if given a chance). The task based systems, however, aimed at efficient task completion with little attention paid to the social or emotional aspects of interaction. The initiative was always with the user and the system was regarded as a tool or servant with no goal other than to answer or carry out a task as efficiently it could.

 

The two kind of systems gave rise to quite different forms of evaluation as well: the chatbots led to the sophisticated but artificial ""Turing Test"" environment of the Loebner competition, while the funded and deployed task-systems---of which the best known were the MIT airline reservation systems like PEGASUS and JUPITER---were evaluated in competitions in terms of time and completion of task rates. However, comparison between systems and their performance proved difficult; no generally applicable and agreed evaluation framework or methodology is available for the companionable systems we are interested in this workshop. We shall ask in the workshop whether  it is possible to measure companionship, and if so, is it possible to include some aspects of it in the evaluation of dialogue systems?

 

Although both the chatbot and task-based traditions began as text-only systems, they were able to take advantage of the rapid advances in speech technology, and fuse speech and language research increasingly. However, none of this led to any obvious advance in what is the goal of this workshop: the exploration of research advances in dialogue systems able to act as Companions. It seems clear that both early traditions have much to contribute to the goal of a Companion, and that it cannot be founded exclusively on either alone.

 

Advances have been expected and achieved in pursuing the overall goal of a Companions in recent years: from the increasing sophistication of ASR and language generation, their integration with NLP and with higher-level issues of emotion and dialogue control; from more sophisticated dialogue management models; from a range of deployable theories of emotion that can be connected directly to text and speech; from the use of new techniques of content extraction in dialogue (such as Information Extraction) and, like every other part of language technology, from the steady advance of machine learning techniques and associated evaluation methods.

ACL mentoring service

ACL is providing a mentoring (coaching) service for authors from regions of the world where English is less emphasized as a language of scientific exchange. Many authors from these regions, although able to read the scientific literature in English, have little or no experience in writing papers in English for conferences such as the ACL meetings. The service will be arranged as follows. A set of potential mentors will be identified by Mentoring Service Chairs BjÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¶rn GambÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¤ck (SICS, Sweden and NTNU, Norway) and Diana McCarthy (Lexical Computing Ltd., UK), who will organize this service for ACL 2010. If you would like to take advantage of the service for a submission to this workshop, please upload your paper in PDF format using the paper submission software for the mentoring service available at:

 

https://www.softconf.com/acl2010/acl2010mentor/

 

The deadline for the mentoring service is six weeks before the workshop submission deadline. An appropriate mentor will be assigned to your paper and the mentor will get back to you no later than two weeks before the submission deadline.

 

Please note that this service is for the benefit of the authors as described above. It is not a general mentoring service for authors to improve the technical content of their papers.

CALL FOR PAPER

More recently, requirements in network management and control have been amended by emerging network and computing models, including wireless sensor networks, ad hoc networks, overlay networks, grid networks, optical networks, multimedia networks, storage networks, the convergence of next generation networks (NGN) or even nano-networks etc. Increasingly ubiquitous network environments require new management strategies, which can cope with resource constraints, multi-federated operations, scalability, dependability, context awareness, security, mobility and probability etc. To bring complex network systems under control, it is necessary for the IT industry to move to autonomic management, autonomic features in both the data and control planes of the network, context-aware management and self-management systems in which technology itself is used to manage technology. New theoretical approaches are needed in resolving the challenging problems in network management including network architectural reference models that incorporate autonomic and self-management principles. This workshop will provide a forum to researchers to propose theories and technologies on the management of emerging networks and services, share their experience of IT and telecommunications industries and discuss future management solutions for emerging networks and services.

(Held in conjunction with ICAI 2010 -  Las Vegas, Nevada, USA)


Call for papers

Mass opinion mining is related both to subjectivity and sentiment analysis, two tasks of growing importance in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), as well as other disciplines such as economics, psychology and sociology. Although studied separately, the task can benefit from an interdisciplinary approach, due to its difficulty and the multitude of facets that it contains. 
The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers in computational linguistics, dealing with subjectivity and sentiment analysis, but also from other disciplines related to the task of mass opinion mining and/or estimation: psychologists, sociologists, economists etc., with the objective of facilitating an interdisciplinary dialogue on the analysis, requirements, issues and applications of the study and modelling of mass opinion.

                      C A L L   f o r   P A P E R S

               *** Submission date extended to April 18 ***

Overview:

   The International Workshop on Parallel and Symbolic Computation (PASCO) 
   is a series of workshops dedicated to the promotion and advancement of
   parallel algorithms and software in all areas of symbolic mathematical 
   computation. The pervasive ubiquity of parallel architectures and 
   memory hierarchy has led to  the emergence of a new quest for parallel 
   mathematical algorithms and software capable of exploiting the various 
   levels of parallelism: from hardware acceleration technologies (multi-
   core and multi-processor system on chip, GPGPU, FPGA) to cluster and
   global computing platforms. To  push up the limits of symbolic and
   algebraic computations, beyond the optimization of the application
   itself, the effective use of a large number of  resources  --memory
   and general or specialized computing units-- is expected to enhance
   the performance multi-criteria objectives: time, energy consumption,
   resource usage, reliability. In this context, the design and the 
   implementation of mathematical algorithms with  provable and adaptive 
   performances is a major challenge.

   Earlier meetings in the PASCO series include PASCO'94 (Linz, Austria),
   PASCO'97 (Maui, U.S.A.), PASCO'07 (London, Canada).
   PASCO 2010 is affiliated with the  2010 International Symposium on 
   Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC) in Munich, Germany.  
   Immediately prior to the ISSAC 2010 meeting, PASCO will be held in 
   Grenoble, France.

   The  workshop  PASCO 2010 will be a three-day event  including  invited
   presentations and tutorials, contributed research papers and posters,
   and a programming contest.
   Specific topics include, but are not limited to:
   * Design and analysis of parallel algorithms for computer algebra
   * Practical parallel implementation of symbolic or symbolic-numeric 
     algorithms
   * High-performance software tools and libraries for computer algebra
   * Applications of high-performance computer algebra
   * Distributed data-structures for computer algebra
   * Hardware acceleration technologies (multi-cores, GPUs, FPGAs) applied
     to computer algebra
   * Cache complexity and cache-oblivious algorithms for computer algebra
   * Compile-time and run-time techniques for automating optimization and
     platform adaptation of computer algebra algorithms

Call for Papers:

   The  conference  invites submission of papers presenting original 
   research, either in the form of extended abstracts (2 pages) or 
   full papers (up to 10 pages) in ACM format. As in previous years,

PURPOSE

The Second IASTED International Conference on Environmental Management and Engineering (EME 2010) will convene scholars, researchers and individuals in government to discuss the challenges posed by the confluence of finite energy supplies, demographic trends and political considerations, and possible solutions to these problems. Threats to the environment, food, and water supplies will be of particular interest. With steady population growth and increasing energy demand around the world, the prudent management of the world's dwindling resources has become an issue of the utmost importance. At the same time, areas with the greatest population growth -- and insatiable energy demand -- are found in nations with high levels of pollution.
CONCURRENT CONFERENCES

EME 2010 will be held in conjunction with the IASTED International Conferences on:

    * Modelling and Simulation (MS 2010)
    * Control and Applications (CA 2010)
    * Wireless Communications (WC 2010)
    * Solar Energy (SOE 2010)

LOCATION

Nestled in the heart of the Canadian Rockies and spanning 6,641 square kilometres of valleys, mountains, glaciers, forests, meadows, and rivers, Banff National Park is truly one of the world's premier destination spots. Banff was Canada's first national park and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Summer in Banff means time to put away the skis and bring out the hiking boots. Banff National Park is a hiking wonderland, containing over 1,600 kilometres of trails. Even in July, the warmest month, the Rockies will fill you with awe as you fish, golf, camp, horseback ride, go whitewater rafting, or take a helicopter ride. Visitors can tour historic sites, soak in hot springs, stroll along the shores of Lake Louise, and enjoy many first class accommodations. Drive the Icefields Parkway into adjoining Jasper National Park and you have an excellent chance of seeing elk, deer, moose, and black bears along the roadside. Take a ride on the Banff gondola or spend just one night camping under the diamond-lit sky and you will be convinced that this is the most beautiful place on earth.

PURPOSE

The Second IASTED International Conference on Solar Energy (SOE 2010) will bring together international researchers and practitioners working at the cutting edge of solar energy, as well as in related areas such as renewable energy and clean energy. The rising price of oil, the diminution of cheap energy sources, and growing global environmental concerns has induced greater interest in alternative sources of energy.
CONCURRENT CONFERENCES

SOE 2010 will be held in conjunction with the IASTED International Conferences on:

    * Modelling and Simulation (MS 2010)
    * Control and Applications (CA 2010)
    * Wireless Communications (WC 2010)
    * Environmental Management and Engineering (EME 2010)

LOCATION

Nestled in the heart of the Canadian Rockies and spanning 6,641 square kilometres of valleys, mountains, glaciers, forests, meadows, and rivers, Banff National Park is truly one of the world's premier destination spots. Banff was Canada's first national park and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Summer in Banff means time to put away the skis and bring out the hiking boots. Banff National Park is a hiking wonderland, containing over 1,600 kilometres of trails. Even in July, the warmest month, the Rockies will fill you with awe as you fish, golf, camp, horseback ride, go whitewater rafting, or take a helicopter ride. Visitors can tour historic sites, soak in hot springs, stroll along the shores of Lake Louise, and enjoy many first class accommodations. Drive the Icefields Parkway into adjoining Jasper National Park and you have an excellent chance of seeing elk, deer, moose, and black bears along the roadside. Take a ride on the Banff gondola or spend just one night camping under the diamond-lit sky and you will be convinced that this is the most beautiful place on earth.

LOCATION

Mild weather, warm water, soft beaches, and emerald rainforests; the island of Maui's charm is irresistible. The second largest of the Hawaiian Islands, Maui was forged by two volcanoes whose lava flows overlapped, forming Maui's two distinct peaks connected by a strip of land, or isthmus. It is this isthmus for which Maui has been dubbed ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThe Valley Isle.' Dormant for the last several hundred years, the volcanic island has long been the home of the Polynesian peoples, who originally came from Tahiti and the Marquesas. The French admiral Jean-FranÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ§ois de La PÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ©rouse was the first European to set foot on the island in 1786, and was closely followed by traders, whalers, loggers, and missionaries. Though these visitors altered both the natural and cultural landscape of Maui, both Maui's natural beauty and rich Polynesian heritage remain well preserved. As a result, Maui is the ideal spot to swim, snorkel, hike, whale watch, explore the traditional culture of the Hawaiians, or just relax on the beach. The city of Lahaina, where our conference will be held, also offers rows of shops and restaurants where you can sample the succulent Hawaiian cuisine, including the delicious fresh fruit grown on Maui. No matter what your tastes or interests, a visit to Maui's charming shores is sure to leave you relaxed and rejuvenated.

The International Association of Science and Technology for Development (IASTED)

PURPOSE

The Fifth IASTED International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (IASTED-HCI 2010) will be a major forum for international researchers and professionals to present their latest research, results, and ideas in all areas of human-computer interaction. Its aim is to strengthen relations between industry, research laboratories, and universities.
CONCURRENT CONFERENCES

IASTED-HCI 2010 will be held in conjunction with the IASTED International Conferences on:

    * Computers and Advanced Technology in Education (CATE 2010)
    * Signal and Image Processing (SIP 2010)
    * Computational Intelligence (CI 2010)
    * Circuits and Systems (CS 2010)

LOCATION

Mild weather, warm water, soft beaches, and emerald rainforests; the island of Maui's charm is irresistible. The second largest of the Hawaiian Islands, Maui was forged by two volcanoes whose lava flows overlapped, forming Maui's two distinct peaks connected by a strip of land, or isthmus. It is this isthmus for which Maui has been dubbed ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThe Valley Isle.' Dormant for the last several hundred years, the volcanic island has long been the home of the Polynesian peoples, who originally came from Tahiti and the Marquesas. The French admiral Jean-FranÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ§ois de La PÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ©rouse was the first European to set foot on the island in 1786, and was closely followed by traders, whalers, loggers, and missionaries. Though these visitors altered both the natural and cultural landscape of Maui, both Maui's natural beauty and rich Polynesian heritage remain well preserved. As a result, Maui is the ideal spot to swim, snorkel, hike, whale watch, explore the traditional culture of the Hawaiians, or just relax on the beach. The city of Lahaina, where our conference will be held, also offers rows of shops and restaurants where you can sample the succulent Hawaiian cuisine, including the delicious fresh fruit grown on Maui. No matter what your tastes or interests, a visit to Maui's charming shores is sure to leave you relaxed and rejuvenated.

Privacy and Identity Management for Life (PrimeLife/IFIP Summer School 2010)
to be held in Helsingborg, Sweden, 2nd - 6th August 2010
in cooperation with the EU FP7 project ETICA
http://www.cs.kau.se/IFIP-summerschool/


After the success of the 2009 PrimeLife/IFIP 
Summer School, the European project PrimeLife and 
IFIP (International Federation for Information 
Processing, Working Groups 9.2, 9.6/11.7 11.4, 
11.6) will continue their joint cooperation. This 
year they will hold an International Summer 
School on the topic of Privacy and Identity 
Management for Emerging Internet Applications throughout a Person's Lifetime.

Emerging Internet Applications, such as Web 2.0 
applications and cloud computing, increasingly 
pose privacy dilemmas. When they communicate over 
the Internet, individuals leave trails of 
personal data which may be stored for many years 
to come. In recent years, social network sites, 
where users tend to disclose very intimate 
personal details about their personal, social, 
and professional lives, have caused serious 
privacy concerns. The collaborative character of 
the Internet enables anyone to compose services 
and distribute information. Due to the low costs 
and technical advances of storage technologies, 
masses of personal data can easily be stored. 
Once disclosed, this data may be retained forever 
and be removed with difficulty. It has become 
hard for individuals to manage and control the 
release and use of information that concerns 
them. They may particularly find it difficult to 
eliminate outdated or unwanted personal information.

These developments raise substantial new 
challenges for personal privacy at the technical, 
social, ethical, regulatory, and legal levels:

    * How can privacy be protected in emerging 
Internet applications such as collaborative scenarios and virtual communities?
    * What frameworks and tools could be used to 
gain, regain and maintain informational 
self-determination and lifelong privacy?

Both IFIP, PrimeLife and ETICA take a holistic 
approach to technology and support 
interdisciplinary exchange. In particular, 
participants' contributions that combine 
technical, legal, regulatory, socio-economic, 
ethical, philosophical, or psychological perspectives are welcome.
We are especially inviting contributions from 
students who are at the stage of preparing either 
masters' or doctoral theses qualifications. The 
school is interactive in character, and is 
composed of keynote lectures and seminars, 
tutorials and workshops with PhD student 
presentations. The principle is to encourage 
young academic and industry entrants to the 
privacy and identity management world to share 
their own ideas and to build up a collegial 
relationship with others. Students that actively 
participate, in particular those who present a 
paper, can receive a course certificate which 
awards 3 ECTS at the PhD level. The certificate 
can certify the topic of the contributed paper to 
demonstrate its relation or non-relation to the student's masters'/PhD thesis.

Related European, national, or regional/community 
research projects are also very welcome to 
present papers or to organise workshops as part of the Summer School.

A special one-day stream within the Summer 
School, to which abstracts/papers can be 
submitted directly, will be organised by the EU 
FP7 project ETICA on privacy and related ethical 
issues that arise from emerging information and communication technologies.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

    * Privacy and identity management 
(technologies, infrastructures, usability 
aspects, legal and social-economic aspects)
    * privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)
    * multilateral Security, anonymity and pseudonymity
    * transparency-enhancing tools
    * privacy and trust policies
    * privacy-aware web service composition
    * semantic web security and privacy
    * privacy and identity management in cloud computing
    * privacy metrics
    * trust management and reputation systems
    * assurance evaluation and control
    * privacy in complex emerging real-life 
scenarios including the use of privacy-enhancing 
mechanisms in various application areas that are 
often lifelong in character (such as eLearning, eHealth, eGovernment)
    * lifelong privacy challenges and sustainable 
privacy and identity management
    * privacy issues relating to social networks, 
social network analysis, profiling, tracking 
technologies, biometrics, surveillance
    * data retention, availability and other legal-regulatory aspects,
    * impact on social exclusion/digital divide/cultural aspects
    * privacy and identity management related 
open source and standardisation initiatives.

We welcome: research papers from all disciplines 
(e.g., computer science, economics, law, 
psychology, sociology); inter-disciplinary work; 
and also contributions on application scenarios, 
use cases, and good practices.

Contributions will be selected based on an 
extended abstract review by the Summer School 
Programme Committee. Accepted short versions of 
papers will be made available to all participants 
in the Summer School Pre-Proceedings. After the 
Summer School, authors will have the opportunity 
to submit their final full papers (which address 
questions and aspects raised during the Summer 
School) for publication in the Summer School 
Proceedings published by the official IFIP 
publisher (Springer). The papers to be included 
in the Final Proceedings will again be reviewed 
and selected by the Summer School Programme Committee.

Helsingborg is located at the coast in Southern 
Sweden very close to Denmark and easily reachable 
via Copenhagen, MalmÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¶ or Gothenburg airport.

Information Retrieval (IR) technology is now part of the ambient work and home environments of many people and organisations. Examples of this are not hard to find, e.g. the widespread use of search engines to access the World Wide Web. IR has therefore become an increasingly important research area.

This conference's aim is to provide an international forum where researchers from both academia and industry can meet and have substantive interaction. CERI welcomes innovative contributions from a wide range of knowledge areas (not only Computer Science but also Information Science, Linguistics, etc.).

Furthermore, within this conference, the organizers aim at promoting the constitution of the Spanish Society of Information Retrieval. This new Society would support IR in Spain and it is the organizers' intention that the Society starts with as much support as possible. All scientists interested in the creation of this Society are welcome to participate.

We encourage national and international researchers to submit original papers, written in spanish or english, related to any aspect of IR including, but not limited to:

    * IR models
    * Evaluation
    * Performance, scalability, architectures and efficiency
    * Structured retrieval (XML, etc)
    * Filtering and recommendation systems
    * Digital libraries
    * Text mining. Classification and clustering
    * Web IR
    * Social networks
    * User studies, models and interaction
    * Multimedia and crosslingual IR

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) offer unprecedented capabilities for integrating sensing with computing and communication as well as for distributed sensing, coordination and control. While WSNs have been a subject of intensive research for about a decade, most research activities to date focused on sensor nodes typically deployed in static, pre-determined locations with sensor readings taken at regular intervals and multi-hopped to a static sink for subsequent storage and analysis. The next evolutionary step for sensor networks is to handle mobility in all its forms. That is, mobility of sinks, mobility of sensors and actuators as well as mobility of code (i.e. applications). The mobility extension represents a more recent research subject in sensor networking; mobility opens up a whole new level of research opportunities and challenges in WSNs, and significantly expands the types of applications for which WSNs can be used. This workshop aims to identifying the benefits and challenges from such a step and outline the state of the art in this particularly promising research area.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Sink mobility in Wireless Sensor Networks
- Actuator networks
- Mobile sensor-actuator networks
- Code mobility in Wireless Sensor Networks
- Mobile agent-based data aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks
- Mobility issues in underwater Wireless Sensor Networks
- Mobility-assisted communication in Wireless Sensor Networks
- Mobility management in Wireless Sensor Networks
- Connectivity maintenance in Wireless Sensor Networks with mobile elements
- Mobility for maximizing network lifetime in Wireless Sensor Networks
- Mobility models for sinks and actuators in Wireless Sensor Networks
- Routing protocols for handling mobility
- Distributed algorithms and reasoning in Wireless Sensor Networks with mobile elements

AIM AND SCOPE
-------------

MONAMI 2010 aims at bringing together top researchers, academics and
practitioners specializing in the area of Mobile Network Management (MNM)
and Service Management.

Multiaccess and resource management, mobility management, and network 
management have emerged as core topics in the design, deployment and
operation of current and future networks. Yet, they are treated as
separate, isolated domains with very little interaction between the experts
in these fields and lack cross-pollination. MONAMI 2010 offers the
opportunity to leading researchers, industry professionals and academics
around the world to meet and discuss the latest advances in these areas
and present results related to technologies for true plug-and-play
networking, efficient use of all infrastructure investments, and access
competition. The aim of the forum is to disseminate the latest innovative
mobile network solutions for increased competition and cooperation in an
environment with a multitude of access technologies, network operators and
business actors.

MONAMI 2010 invites papers that follow either evolutionary approaches based
on current IP-centered architectures or introduce revolutionary MNM
approaches and new paradigms. Papers reporting experimental and empirical
studies as well as implementation/industry results (including testbeds and
field trials) are also welcome.

Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
	- Multiaccess networks and resource management
	- Energy efficiency for multiaccess networks
	- Security solutions for managed and infrastructureless networks
	- Emerging and visionary multimedia services, service enablers
	  and management
	- Identity management for mobile users
	- Multimedia services in mobile/multiaccess networks
	- Business models and Economics for a mobile/multiaccess world
	- Future Internet architectures for Mobile Network Management
	- Autonomic computing and self-management
	- Management standards and enabling technologies, including
	  IEEE 802.21
	- Management of wireless cognitive networks
	- Design, implementation, and testbed/experimental evaluations
	- Management of the Internet of the Things.
	- Service and application management platforms.

The World Wide Web has become the carrier for the largest human knowledge 
repository in history. As its knowledge bases are growing towards a 
practically ""infinite"" volume, Web-scale Knowledge Representation, Retrieval, 
and Reasoning (Web-KR3) is becoming a real issue and an urgent task. Although 
the Web community has developed a number of knowledge representation 
languages and reasoning methods, when the volume goes Web-scale, existing 
approaches meet many challenging problems, such as scalability, inconsistency, 
uncertainty and dynamics. Hence, a unified approach to Web-KR3 needs to be 
developed.

This workshop thus aims to bringing together researchers from Web research, 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), high performance computing, cognitive science, 
knowledge management, and machine learning to discuss all issues of Web-KR3 
in a synergistic setting. The workshop is a full day workshop and will be 
co-located with the 2010 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web 
Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology.

Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, 12th of October 2010


Wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs), as a scientific topic, are currently the subject of intensive world-wide research activities. The sensor technology promises multiple applications: from monitoring an environment in dangerous regions or enemy forces in a battlefield to controlling traffic in streets, inventory in storehouses and tracking patients in hospitals. On the one hand, small and cheap sensing devices create possibilities for gathering huge amounts of data in a non-intrusive way. On the other hand, actuators add a new network dimension and capabilities: the whole system can also react to the forthcoming events.

Still, there are crucial questions which are not answered. Could we design a low-cost sensor technology which enables its massive and pervasive application? Could WSANs be really independent and intelligent systems performing their tasks autonomously without any external control?

The goal of this workshop is to gather people from academia and industry and discuss the most emerging issues and future challenges in the area of WSANs.

The topics of the workshop include but are not limited to:

 * Low cost, low-complexity, low-price sensor technology
 * Collaborative and distributed schemes
 * Self-organized networks
 * Biologically inspired WSANs
 * Localization and positioning algorithms
 * Routing and MAC protocols
 * Target detection, identification and tracking
 * Cross layer issues
 * Network coverage, connectivity, topology, deployment of nodes
 * Scalability, robustness, energy efficiency issues
 * Data aggregation schemes
 * Reliability, self-healing and recovery procedures
 * Monitoring and surveillance systems
 * Security and privacy issues
 * Mobile sensor and actuator networks
 * Dynamic network topologies
 * Sensor networks modelling and simulations
 * Prototypes, test-beds and field measurements
 * Sensor network applications


Paper submission:

Authors are kindly invited to submit the manuscripts prepared according to IEEE submission guidelines and not exceeding 8 pages (2 more pages are possible with extra charge).

** NEWS
Outstanding papers from MIST 2010, after further revisions, will be published in 
Special Issue of Security and Communication Networks (SCN)(indexed by SCIE) 

**Overview

During the past decades, information security developments have been mainly concerned 
with preventing illegal attacks by outsiders, such as hacking, virus propagation, and spyware. 
However, according to a recent Gartner Research Report, information leakage caused by insiders who are legally authorized to have access to some corporate information is increasing dramatically. 
These leakages can cause significant damages such as weakening the competitiveness of companies (and even countries). Information leakage caused by insiders occurs less frequently than information leakage caused by outsiders, but the financial damage is much greater. 
Countermeasures in terms of physical, managerial, and technical aspects are necessary 
to construct an integral security management system to protect companies' major information assets from unauthorized internal attackers. 
The objective of this workshop is to showcase the most recent challenges and advances in security technologies and management systems to prevent leakage of organizations' information caused by insiders. 
It may also include state-of-the-art surveys and case analyses of practical significance. 
We expect that the workshop will be a trigger for further research and technology improvements related to this important subject.

**Topics (include but are not limited to)

-Theoretical foundations and algorithms for addressing insider threats
-Insider threat assessment and modelling
-Security technologies to prevent, detect and avoid insider threats
-Validating the trustworthiness of staff
-Post-insider threat incident analysis
-Data breach modelling and mitigation techniques
-Registration, authentication and identification
-Certification and authorization
-Database security
-Device control system 
-Digital forensic system
-Digital right management system
-Fraud detection
-Network access control system
-Intrusion detection
-Keyboard information security 
-Information security governance
-Information security management systems
-Risk assessment and management
-Log collection and analysis 
-Trust management
-IT compliance (audit)
-Continuous auditing

                       CALL FOR PAPERS

In recent years, collaborative efforts facilitated by the Internet seem
to have the answer for the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. More and more
resources and collaborative endeavours have started to be incorporated and
exploited as knowledge repositories for various tasks. Wikipedia with its
many facets and knowledge bearing structuring, the tags associated with
images in Flickr, question-answer collections in Yahoo! Answers are a few
examples of such information sources. Amazon's Mechanical Turk gives
researchers access to ""human computation"" power, and is being used more
and more as a solution to the difficult problems of large scale
evaluations and data annotation, both crucial for the continuous
development of the AI and NLP fields.

AI and NLP have the potential to both exploit and dig deeper in the mines
of collective knowledge, and to help build them, by providing tools for
helping generate more, better and consistent content. As with the previous
events, we believe work in this area should be encouraged, followed and
popularized, to promote the synergy between repositories of
user-contributed knowledge and research in Artificial Intelligence.

The workshop is intended to be highly interdisciplinary. We encourage
participation of researchers from different perspectives, including (but
not limited to) machine learning, computational linguistics, information
retrieval, information extraction, question answering, knowledge
representation, human computer interaction and others. We also encourage
participation of researchers from other areas who might benefit from the
use of large bodies of machine-readable knowledge.

An upcoming special issue of the Artificial Intelligence Journal 
will be devoted to the topic of ""Artificial Intelligence, Wikipedia, 
and Semi-Structured Resources"".


______Topics

Topics covered by this workshop include, but are not limited to:

 * Using user-contributed knowledge as a source of training data
   for AI tasks (both supervised and unsupervised)
 * Automatic methods for improving the quality of user contributions
 * Modeling tasks for human computation
 * Integrating different resources (e.g. Wikipedia and WN/Cyc/other
   ontologies)
 * Extracting annotated data from user contributions
 * Enriching user contributions with new types of structural information
 * User-contributed knowledge and the Semantic Web/Web 2.0
 * Automatic extraction and use of cross-lingual information
 * Computerized use of satellite Wiki projects such as Wiktionary,
   Wikibooks or Wikispecies
 * Human computation like Amazon Mechanical Turk to help AI tasks
 * Data mining on collaboratively-contributed resources
 * Innovative graph algorithms exploiting collaborative resources
 * Word Sense Disambiguation with Wikipedia, Wiktionary, etc.


______Important Dates

Submission deadline: March 29th 2010
Notification date: April 15th 2010
Camera-ready deadline: April 30th 2010
Workshop date: July 11th or 12th 2010


______Submission

The review process is *not* double-blinded. Submissions should be regular
full papers (up to 6 pages), short papers reporting on late-breaking
results (up to 3 pages), and descriptions of system demonstrations
(up to 1 page). Please refer to the AAAI author instruction page

CONTEXT

SDMAS is a series of workshops that has been annually held from 2007. The 
scope of SDMAS workshop is focused on scalability of data management in 
computing systems in various domains. 

Data management has become a key issue in many computing systems. 
High-performance computing, data visualization, multimedia and data mining 
systems are examples of application areas where input/output and storage are 
critical issues for performance. A key challenge in those areas is how to 
transfer large amounts of data in and out of large-scale systems, like 
clusters, Grids and more recently in Cloud Computing environments. Another 
key point is how to transfer large amount of data in a timely manner. The aim 
of the workshop is to identify, discuss, and share the barriers and workarounds 
that have been discovered in the storage, input/output and data management 
fields.

GOAL

The Fourth International Workshop on Scalable Data Management Applications and 
Systems is a forum that brings together researchers and practitioners interested 
in different aspects of data management systems and its applications to industry. 
The workshop seeks to act as a conduit for the presentation of novel approaches 
used in data management (from the hardware layer to the higher software layers) 
as well as their application to research and industry. 

As in previous editions, the workshop will be held along with the International 
Conference on Parallel and Distributed Processing Techniques and Applications 
(PDPTA). PDPTA is a premier conference in the parallel and distributed computing 
arena which offers the opportunity to interact with researchers and practitioners.

Venue: Valencia, Spain


Event Date:25-28 October, 2010


SCOPE

Knowledge Management (KM) is a discipline concerned with the analysis and technical support of practices used in an organization to identify, create, represent, distribute and enable the adoption and leveraging of good practices embedded in collaborative settings and, in particular, in organizational processes. Effective knowledge management is an increasingly important source of competitive advantage, and a key to the success of contemporary organizations, bolstering the collective expertise of its employees and partners.
There are several perspectives on KM, but all share the same core components, namely: People, Processes and Technology. Some take a techno-centric focus, in order to enhance knowledge integration and creation; some take an organizational focus, in order to optimize organization design and workflows; some take an ecological focus, where the important aspects are related to people interaction, knowledge and environmental factors as a complex adaptive system similar to a natural ecosystem.
Information Sharing (IS) is a term used for a long time in the information technology (IT) lexicon, related to data exchange, communication protocols and technological infrastructures. Although standardization is indeed an essential element for sharing information, IS effectiveness requires going beyond the syntactic nature of IT and delve into the human functions involved in the semantic, pragmatic and social levels of organizational semiotics.
The two areas are intertwined as information sharing is the foundation for knowledge management. KMIS aims at becoming a major meeting point for researchers and practitioners interested in the study and application of all perspectives of Knowledge Management and Information Sharing.

CALL FOR PAPERS

8th International Conference on Service Oriented Computing (ICSOC) 2010

December 7 - 10 2010, San Francisco, California, USA

www.icsoc.org

******************************************************************

The conference

Since 2003, ICSOC has been the prime forum for academics and industry researchers and developers to report and share groundbreaking works in service oriented computing. ICSOC has fostered cross-community scientific excellence by the gathering of experts from various disciplines, such as business process management, distributed systems, computer networks, wireless & mobile computing, grid computing, networking, service science, management science, and software engineering.

Service innovation is key to the future of business. Even in traditionally manufacturing-driven industries, such as IT, the importance of service has surpassed most other corporate competences.  The Internet and Web-based services create ever more opportunities for service innovation.  Service science is an interdisciplinary approach to the study, design, and implementation of service systems ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the specific arrangements of people, organizations, technologies, and information that cocreate value. Service systems are often IT-enabled and knowledge-intensive, and can span different real or virtual organizations. In this multidisciplinary context, researchers and practitioners in management, social sciences, and computer sciences are all working together to promote and facilitate service innovation.   

While keeping its roots in scientific excellence and technical depth of service technology, ICSOC 2010 aims to combine the general technical issues with application and business-oriented aspects of service design, following the recent emergence of service science as an interdisciplinary foundation to rationalize and integrate various aspects of service systems.

ICSOC 2010 will bring together scientists, engineers, and practitioners from multiple disciplines to focus on service innovation--enabled by computational and information technology and by complex interactions among systems.

The conference will feature research and industry presentations, keynote presentations, workshops, demonstrations, tutorials, and a PhD track. Please refer to www.icsoc.org for calls for workshops, demonstrations, and tutorials.

Subject and Purpose of the Workshop
We lately witness a tremendous development in the wireless sensor networking (WSN), which make it possible to monitor, unobtrusively and for long periods 
of time the physical environment and to collect the relevant data. For many applications, the sensor networks cannot operate in complete isolation. 
There must be a way enabling a monitoring entity or some end-users to gain access to the data produced by the sensor network, and even to interact with a 
particular sensor mote to activate/deactivate it, read the sensed value instantaneously, fix some inner parameters, make dynamic code loading into the 
mote, etc. By connecting the sensor network to an existing network infrastructure such as a local-area network, a private intranet, mobile smart networks, 
and notably the global internet, gaining remote access to the sensor network would be straightforward. However, many questions need answers, and many 
challenges must be tackled before such interconnection become effective. Suitability of IP standards must be investigated, as well as the connection 
architecture. Is it more effective to use fixed gateways? Or is it better to employ a dynamic ad hoc mode where all nodes (or several nodes) cooperatively 
and alternatively act as gateways. By openly connect a sensor network to other networks new vulnerabilities will take place. An intruder would not need to 
gain physical access to the network anymore, but it might remotely launch attacks. Security is thus a very important aspect that must be considered. 
Routing, QoS, and interoperability are also important and challenging issues in the new heterogeneous systems. This workshop is a forum for researchers, 
academics, and industrials to debate the different issues related to the interconnection of wireless sensor networks, and discuss relevant theoretical 
and practical solutions. 

Topics
Topics of the workshop consist of all aspects related to WSN., with more focus on the interconnection and integration of WSN to other networks. 
They include but not limited to:
-	Interconnection architecture aspects
-	Authentication and security issues
-	Vulnerability, protection, and fault-tolerance of WSN
-	Quality of Service (QoS) issues in WSN-based integrated networks
-	Integration of Body area networks to WLAN and beyond
-	Information processing
-	Transport Layer protocols, and congestion control issues.
-	Routing protocols for cross networks 
-	Medium access control protocols 
-	Network and transport layer protocols for cross networks 
-	Testbeds for integrated networks 
-	Middlewares
-	Integrated applications and services for cross networks 
-	Sensor tasking, control, and actuation
-	Distributed query processing 
-	In-network processing and aggregation 
-	Connectivity & longevity 
-	Location and time services
-	Integration of sensor networks and web-based services.

Security (MINES 2010)

http://stegano.net/workshop

**************************************************************************


Network steganography is part of information hiding focused on modern 
networks and is a method of hiding secret data in users' normal data 
transmissions, ideally, so it cannot be detected by third parties. 
Steganographic techniques arise and evolve with the development of 
network protocols and mechanisms, and are expected to be used in secret 
communication or information sharing. Now, it becomes a hot topic due to 
the wide spread of information networks, e.g., multimedia service 
networks and social networks. 

This year's workshop's main theme is network anomaly detection.

The workshop is dedicated to capture such areas of research as steganography, 
steganalysis, and digital forensics in the meaning of network covert channels, 
investigate the potential applications, and discuss the future research topics. 
Research themes of the workshop will include:

- Steganography and steganalysis
- Covert/subliminal channels
- Novel applications of information hiding in networks
- Political and business issues related to network steganography
- Information hiding in multimedia services
- Digital forensics
- Network communication modelling from the viewpoint of steganography 
and steganalysis
- New methods for detecting and eliminating network steganography

** Overview

Ubiquitous computing is an emerging field of research for computing paradigms in the 21st century.
This emergence is the natural result of research and technological advances mainly in wireless 
communications, mobile computing, embedded computing, autonomic computing and agent technologies. 
The goal of ubiquitous computing is to enable the fabrics of everyday life with
seamless and intelligent computers, devices, technologies and services.

Ubiquitous computing is a post-desktop model of human-computer interaction 
in which information processing has been thoroughly integrated into everyday objects and activities. 
In the course of ordinary activities, we use many computational devices and systems simultaneously.
This paradigm is also described as pervasive computing or ambient intelligence.
When primarily concerning the objects involved, it is also physical computing, the Internet of Things, 
haptic computing, and things that think. 

Ubiquitous computing is the third wave in computing, starting with mainframes and personal computing.
In general, people live through their practices and tacit knowledge so that 
the most powerful things are those that are effectively invisible in use. 
It is invisible, everywhere computing that does not 
live on a personal device of any sort, but is everywhere. 

Ubicomp is an interdisciplinary field that includes technologies that bridge the digital 
and physical worlds, systems and applications that incorporate such technologies, 
infrastructures that support them, human activities and experiences these technologies facilitate.

Conference Scope:
-----------------

Cloud Computing is an emerging computing paradigm envisioned to change all IT 
landscape facets including technology, business, services and human resources. 
It is a consumer/delivery model that offers IT capabilities as services, billed 
based on usage. Many such cloud services can be envisioned, but the main ones 
are IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service), and SaaS 
(Software-as-a-Service). The underlying cloud architecture includes a pool of 
virtualized compute, storage and networking resources that can be aggregated and
launched as platforms to run workloads and satisfy their Service-Level Agreement
(SLA). Cloud architectures also include provisions to best guarantee service 
delivery for clients and at the same time optimize efficiency of resources of 
providers. Examples of provisions include, but not limited to, elasticity 
through scaling resources up/down to track workload behavior, extensive 
monitoring, failure mitigation, and energy optimizations. The two main 
technologies enabling clouds are: (i) Virtualization, the foundation of clouds; 
and (ii) manageability (autonomics), the command and control of clouds.

CloudComp is intended to bring together researchers, developers, and industry 
professionals to discuss clouds, cloud computing and related ecosystems support.
To that end, papers are solicited from all cloud related areas, including, but 
not limited to:

1. Cloud architectures and provisions to optimize providersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ environments while

by the School of Computing and Information Engineering at the University
of Ulster and will take place in the Ramada Hotel, Portrush from the 16th
to the 18th May, 2010. The conference is organised under the auspices of
the Irish Statistical Association.

CASI brings together theoreticians and practitioners, industrialists and
academics, from the numerous related disciplines involved in the
processing and analysis of data. CASI 2010 will be a single-track
conference starting with a poster session, reception and dinner in the
afternoon and evening of Sunday 16th May and continuing with oral
presentations on the 17th and 18th May. There will be a conference dinner
in the University of Ulster in Coleraine on the Monday evening, with CASI
finishing mid Tuesday afternoon. The conference emphasises both
theoretical research results and practical applications in all areas of
statistics. The programme also includes talks by invited speakers.

We are pleased to announce that CASI 2010 will include keynote talks by:
- Professor George Gettinby, University of Strathclyde
- Professor Paul Harper, Cardiff University
- Rachel Linney, National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, Portlaoise.
- Professor Fionn Murtagh, Royal Holloway, University of London and SFI
These lectures will cover diverse topics ranging from Cataract Surgery to Healthcare Modelling and Pattern Recognition to Statistical Education.

The North West 200 motor bike race is held annually on the North Coast of 
Northern Ireland and runs between the towns of Portrush, Portstewart, and
Coleraine. More than 150,000 spectators line the local roads between to
watch the races and the whole week takes on a festival atmosphere with
concerts and other entertainment.

The 2010 date for the North West 200 is 9 May to 16 May so there will be
opportunities to come to CASI a few days early and join in the fun. In any
case it is likely to add to CASI's usual lively atmosphere. However the
downside is that hotels will be busy and prices will increase so we
encourage you to book as soon as possible and definitely by the end of
March.

The closing date for abstracts is: Friday 26th March

103,Interdisciplinary Workshop on Verbs. The Identification and Representation of Verb Features,04/11/2010,05/11/2010,"Pisa, Italy",20/06/2010,01/08/2010,15/09/2010,"Interdisciplinary Workshop on Verbs
             The Identification and Representation of Verb Features
                 Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa 4-5 November 2010
                     http://linguistica.sns.it/Workshop_verb/

_________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Workshop Description

Verbs and their features have always received wide attention
in various disciplines concerned with linguistic research,
since their contribution is essential to the structure and
the interpretation of language. In recent years, the availability
of new lexical resources and increasingly large corpora, the
application of empirical methods and statistical algorithms and
the development of technical devices such as eye-trackers and
magnetic resonance imaging has led to advances in several
linguistic areas.

Their great interest and relevance  notwithstanding, verbs still
defy attempts by linguists and cognitive scientists to achieve
a clear understanding of their organisational principles, as well
as of the features entering  into their constitution. Verb
complexity derives not only from  their notoriously high polysemy,
but also and especially from the fact that verbs are crucially
the cornerstone of the syntax-semantics interface. The semantic
behaviour of verbs is therefore strongly intertwined with the
syntagmatic constraints governing their distributions. As a
consequence, while there is a consensus on the multifarious nature
of verb semantic representations, the different types of verb
features analysed in the literature (e.g., event properties,
argument structure, aspect, etc.) still lie as separate pieces
of a puzzle which is far from complete.

Success in this type of research is brought about by close
collaboration between (computational) linguists and cognitive
scientists. To this end, interdisciplinary workshops can play
a key role in advancing existing and initiating new research.
This was demonstrated by the interest generated by the Verb
Workshop 2005, which received 33 submissions and was held as
a standalone event at Saarland University over 2 days. A more
clear understanding of the (computational) linguistic and
cognitive properties of verbs will bring a positive reflection
on the results of the research done within these communities.
Therefore there is a real need to provide a forum where
researchers can meet across disciplines.

The aim of this interdisciplinary workshop is to bring together
researchers from linguistic domains such as linguistics,
computational linguistics, computational lexicography,
psycholinguistics, cognitive science and neuroscience, in order
to discuss their perspectives on verb senses and verb features,
exchanging new ideas and methods. Such an event can help to
bridge the gap between the linguistic, computational and cognitive
communities, promote knowledge and resource sharing, and help
initiate interdisciplinary research projects.

The focus of the workshop is on the identification and
representation of verb features at the syntax-semantics interface.
Papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

         *    Empirical studies and formal descriptions of verb
              features and verb senses: these are some of the key
              fundamental factors in verb treatment, and are relevant
              for representing and distinguishing verbs across
              disciplines.

         *    Representation of verbs by verb classes:
              generalisation is crucial to the acquisition of verbs
              and categorisation in cognitive linguistics, and for
              many computational linguistic tasks; computational
              learning of verb classes and properties provides
              insights into argument alternations, verb polysemy,
              selectional preferences, etc.

         *    Cognitively motivated models of verbs: the definition
              of verb semantics according to human perception,
              the collection of human judgements on verb senses
              and verb properties, and psycholinguistic studies
              and experiments on verbs are important interdisciplinary
              contributions to verb characterisation.

         *    Evidence from cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology
              on verb features and corpus-based methods to extract
              empirical features: the distributional account of verb
              senses and verb features provides essential contributions
              to verb analysis. We also welcome contributions on the
              use of distributional data to model (neuro)cognitive
              evidence on verb representation.

         *    Data resources and tools: the definition of verb senses
              and verb properties are important for basic and
              task-oriented research; especially the annotation of
              lexical verb information provides valuable data to
              computational learning procedures and evaluation
              methods.

         *    Language-specific and cross-linguistic aspects of verbs:
              which verb features are specific to a language, and
              which are universal?

SCOPE

The purpose of the 3rd International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence (ICAART) is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in the theory and applications in these areas. Two simultaneous but strongly related tracks will be held, covering both applications and current research work within the area of Agents, Multi-Agent Systems and Software Platforms, Distributed Problem Solving and Distributed AI in general, including web applications, on one hand, and within the area of non-distributed AI, including the more traditional areas such as Knowledge Representation, Planning, Learning, Scheduling, Perception and also not so traditional areas such as Reactive AI Systems, Evolutionary Computing and other aspects of Computational Intelligence and many other areas related to intelligent systems, on the other hand. 



Conference Areas

Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following conference areas:

1. Artificial Intelligence
2. Agents

CALL FOR PAPERS

The WASDeTT workshop series is motivated by the observation that tools and tool building play an important role in applied academic software engineering research. The tangible results of research projects are often embodied in a tool. Even though tool building is a popular technique to validate research (e.g., proof-of-concept prototyping followed by user studies), it is neither simple nor cheap to accomplish. Given the importance of tool building and the significant cost associated with it, our workshop allows interested researchers to share their tool building experiences and to explore how tools can be build more effectively and efficiently.

The purpose of this workshop is not to focus on any specific kind of these tools but rather to gather researchers working on different tools, with the goal of providing a forum where tool builders can talk about common issues relevant to all tool builders, and builders of academic research prototypes in particular, such as :
- Should tool building remain a craft?
- Should academic tools be of commercial quality?
- How to integrate and combine independently developed tools?
- What are the positive lessons learned and pitfalls in building tools?
- What are effective techniques to improve the quality of academic tools?
- What is needed to build an active community of developers and users?
- Are there any useful tool building patterns for software engineering tools?
- How to compare or benchmark such tools?
- What particular languages and paradigms are suited to build tools?

Contributions

The workshop solicits the submission of two kinds of papers:

Tool-related papers present an (academic) tool and discuss how the tool was built. The paper should address issues such as the toolÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s architecture, important design decisions and their impact on functional requirements and quality attributes, and lessonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s learned that are of interest to other tool builders.

Position papers state a novel position or vision on issues related to tool building. Importantly, such a paper should serve as a foundation for interesting discussions at the workshop. In spite of our focus on experimental research tools, we explicitly solicit position papers from software industrials as well.

EST Special Issue

This workshop is associated with an Experimental Software and Toolkits (EST) special issue to be published in ElsevierÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s Science of Computer Programming. All tool-related workshop papers (not the position papers) are potential candidates for the special issue. The authors of a subset of these articles will be invited to submit to EST based on the quality of their paper and their tool demonstration during the workshop.

For the special issue, a thoroughly revised version of the accepted WASDeTT paper has to be submitted along with the actual tool. The tool itself will be evaluated based upon the following criteria: ease of installation, quality of (user) documentation, ease of usage, applicability to the intended domain, and quality of source code (optional).

More details can be found on the workshop web site: 
	http://www.info.fundp.ac.be/wasdett2010/?page_id=61

Submission Instructions

Please keep all position papers between 5-10 pages, and tool-related papers between 10-20 pages.

Papers have to be submitted with the EasyChair conference system here:
	http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wasdett3

Papers have to be in PDF, so that we can easily publish all accepted papers on this web site later on. Use the style guidelines for Elsevier journal papers (mandatory for tool-related papers, optional for position papers):
	http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/authorsview.authors/elsarticle

There will be an upper limit of about 20 on the number of papers that can be accepted and, due to space limitations, it is likely (unless that limit is not reached) that no more than one author per paper can participate in the workshop.

INTRODUCTION

There is a growing interdisciplinary community of researchers and
research groups working on logical aspects of MAS from the perspectives
of logic, artificial intelligence, computer science, game theory, etc.
This workshop is planned to serve two mutually supporting purposes.
First, it will be used as a conference workshop, hosting presentation,
exchange, and publication of original research ideas. Secondly, we would
like to discuss the possibility of setting up a long-term coordination
structure for scientists working in logical aspects of MAS. In the long
run, LAMAS can play the role of a regular meeting for that structure.

The workshop is intended to cover the following subjects:
- Logical systems for specification, analysis, and reasoning about MAS
- Modeling MAS with logic-based models
- Deductive systems for logics for MAS
- Development, complexity analysis, and implementation of algorithmic
  methods for formal verification of MAS
- Applications of logics in MAS.

SUBMISSION

We encourage submission of papers reporting original unpublished
research. Position papers and visionary work in progress can also be
submitted. Submissions should be anonymous (subject to double-blind
reviewing procedure), and not exceeding 15 pages in the Springer LNCS
format. For templates and instructions for authors, see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html . Each submission will be
reviewed by at least 2 Program Committee members.

PROCEEDINGS AND POST-PROCEEDINGS

All the accepted papers will appear in the informal workshop proceedings
(published together with the AAMAS proceedings). We envisage that
selected papers will be invited to a special issue of JANCL (Journal of
Applied Non-Classical Logics).

WORKSHOP SCOPE

Virtualization has proven to be a powerful enabler in the field of distributed computing and has led to the emergence of the cloud computing paradigm and the provisioning of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). This new paradigm raises challenges ranging from performance evaluation of IaaS platforms, through new methods of resource management including providing Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and energy- and cost-efficient schedules, to the emergence of supporting technologies such as virtual appliance management.

For the last three years, the VTDC workshop has served as a forum for the exchange of ideas and experiences studying the challenges and opportunities created by IaaS/cloud computing and virtualization technologies. VTDC brings together researchers in academia and industry who are involved in research and development on resource virtualization technologies and on techniques applied to the management of virtualized environments in distributed systems.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

SCOPE
The 2nd International ICST Conference on Arts and Technology (ArtsIT2010) will be held in Chongqing, China on 10-12 December 2010. The conference will be a meeting forum for both people in arts with a keen interest in modern IT technologies and people in IT with strong ties to arts. The objective of the conference is to bring art closer to people and to provide artists with a creative tool to extend their ways of artistic expression.
With the evolution of intelligent devices, sensors and ambient intelligent/ubiquitous systems, it is not surprising to see numerous research and art projects starting to explore the design of intelligent artistic artifacts. Ambient intelligence supports the vision that technology will become invisible, embedded in our natural surroundings, present whenever we need it, attuned to all of our senses, adaptive to users and context, and acting autonomously. High quality art or information should be potentially available to any user, anywhere, at any time, with any device. The information
environments will be the major drivers of culture which will eventually lead to the futureÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂi4 space (intelligent, interactive, invisible and informative), a utopian kind of life.

LOCATION

Botswana has been called an oasis of peace and tranquility on the African continent. It has a history of political stability, a low crime rate, and is one of Africa's most successful economies. Botswana is about the size of France or Kenya, but its low population density has ensured that its beautiful wilderness has remained unspoiled. Botswana is home to 120,000 migrant elephants ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the largest elephant population in the world. The Kalahari Desert covers 84% of the country, yet in the midst of this desert is the world's largest inland delta. The Okavango Delta is a breathtaking labyrinth of lagoons, lakes, and hidden channels covering an area of 17000 kmÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ². There you will find the Moremi Game Reserve, with forests, floodplains, and lagoons that offer spectacular glimpses of a huge diversity of plant and animal life, including lions, buffalo, crocodiles, and leopards. The administrative centre for Botswana's strong economy, the capital city of Gaborone, is a fast-growing, vibrant modern city. Shop the amazing collections of local arts and crafts and you will fall in love with Botswana's rich culture and history. Enjoy the many fine restaurants and nightclubs, or take a quiet walk up Kgale Hill to see an amazing view of the city, as well as the pair of black eagles that nest in the craggy cliff face just below the peak.

LOCATION

Botswana has been called an oasis of peace and tranquility on the African continent. It has a history of political stability, a low crime rate, and is one of Africa's most successful economies. Botswana is about the size of France or Kenya, but its low population density has ensured that its beautiful wilderness has remained unspoiled. Botswana is home to 120,000 migrant elephants ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the largest elephant population in the world. The Kalahari Desert covers 84% of the country, yet in the midst of this desert is the world's largest inland delta. The Okavango Delta is a breathtaking labyrinth of lagoons, lakes, and hidden channels covering an area of 17000 kmÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ². There you will find the Moremi Game Reserve, with forests, floodplains, and lagoons that offer spectacular glimpses of a huge diversity of plant and animal life, including lions, buffalo, crocodiles, and leopards. The administrative centre for Botswana's strong economy, the capital city of Gaborone, is a fast-growing, vibrant modern city. Shop the amazing collections of local arts and crafts and you will fall in love with Botswana's rich culture and history. Enjoy the many fine restaurants and nightclubs, or take a quiet walk up Kgale Hill to see an amazing view of the city, as well as the pair of black eagles that nest in the craggy cliff face just below the peak.

INTRODUCTION

Vision in general and images in particular have always played an important
and essential role in human life. In the past they were, today they are, and
in the future they will continue to be one of our most important information
carriers. Nowadays, image processing and computer vision have numerous
commercial, scientific, industrial and military applications. All these
applications result from the interaction between fundamental scientific
research on the one hand, and the development of new and high-standard
technology on the other hand.

In order to cope with the variety of image processing and computer vision
challenges, several techniques have been introduced and developed, quite
often with great success. Among the different techniques that are currently
in use, we also encounter soft computing techniques. Soft Computing is an
emerging field that consists of complementary elements of fuzzy logic,
neural computing, evolutionary computation, machine learning and
probabilistic reasoning, and often offers solutions where conventional
approaches fail.

The 2nd Workshop on Soft Computing in Image Processing and Computer Vision
(SCIPCV) aims to provide a forum for current state-of-the-art approaches of
soft computing techniques in image processing, computer vision and related
applications.

TOPICS

High quality submissions are sought; topics include, but are not limited to,
soft computing approaches such as

     * fuzzy logic
     * neural networks
     * evolutionary computing
     * rough sets
     * swarm intelligence
     * etc.

in/for

     * image analysis: edge detection, segmentation, pattern recognition,
object recognition, interpretation
     * image enhancement: filtering, noise removal, enhancement, restoration
     * image compression
     * image reconstruction
     * image similarity and image retrieval
     * satellite image processing
     * medical image processing
     * mathematical morphology
     * wavelets
     * video processing and retrieval
     * image formation and physics based vision
     * 3-d processing
     * shape-from-X
     * scene understanding
     * etc.

IMPORTANT DATES

     * Manuscript submission: March 15, 2010
     * Notification of acceptance: April 1, 2010

Interest in and needs for provenance are growing as data proliferates. Data is increasing in a wide array of application areas, including scientific workflow systems, logical reasoning systems, text extraction, social media, and linked data. As data increases and as applications become more hybrid and distributed in nature, there is increasing interest in where data came from and how it was produced in order to understand when and how to rely on it.

Provenance, or the origin or source of something, can capture a wide range of information. This includes, for example, who or what generated the data, history of data stewardship, manner of manufacture, place and time of manufacture, and so on. Annotation is tightly connected with provenance since data is often commented on, described, and referred to. These descriptions or annotations are often critical to the understandability, reusability, and reproducibility of data and thus are often critical components of today?s data and knowledge systems.

Provenance has been recognized to be important in a wide range of areas including databases, workflows, knowledge representation and reasoning, and digital libraries. Thus, many disciplines have proposed a wide range of provenance models, techniques, and infrastructure for encoding and using provenance. One timely challenge for the broader community is to understand the range of strengths and weaknesses of different approaches sufficiently to find and use the best models for any given situation. This also comes at a time when a new incubator group has been formed at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to provide a state of the art understanding and develop a roadmap in the area of provenance for Semantic Web technologies, development, and possible standardization.

Pre-conference workshops and ICADÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s graduate student ThinkTank (doctoral consortium) will be held on June 9 and 10, and the conference itself will run from June 11 to 15.

ICAD is a highly interdisciplinary conference with relevance to researchers, practitioners, artists, and graduate students working in the use of sound to convey information and ideas. The conference is unique in its specific focus on auditory displays and the range of interdisciplinary issues related to their use. Like its predecessors, ICAD 2010 will be a single-track conference, open to all, with no membership or affiliation requirements.

Consistent with this yearÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s theme, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂSonic DiscourseÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂExpression through Sound,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ICAD 2010 invites the submission of new work and developments in all areas of interest to those who work with sound as a medium for conveying information and ideas. The conference emphasizes the concerns shared by those who work primarily with informational and affective aspects of sound including sonification of data and processes, synthetic and composed sound, musical sound, natural sound, and all issues related to interaction with sound, specifically, how it is presented to, and apprehended by, listeners. Thus, submissions are sought on topics that extend from basic research in auditory display, to application domains in the arts and sciences, mobile applications, accessibility, audio technology, information and communications technology, computer games, engineering analysis, medicine, and more.

Each year we aim to attract a wide variety of researchers and practitioners to the ICAD community who work in fields that are concerned with and/or related to computationally based, informational uses of sound. Thus, in addition to ICAD's core interests, we hope to attract submissions from composers and artists who use sonification, acoustic synthesis, spatialization, and/or interaction techniques for composition and performance purposes. Although we fully intend to maintain ICADÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s primary emphasis on the use of sound as information, we specifically want to encourage a wider and more collaborative dialogue between practitioners with disparate objectives in auditory display.

In keeping with the goal of enlarging the ICAD community, this year's conference will have a new aural submission category for sonifications and aural compositions that employ computational auditory display techniques. Submissions in this category will be presented to the full conference as part of the Concert program on the second night of the main conference.

ICAD 2010 is being jointly organised by the International Community for Auditory Display; VRSonic, Inc.; The George Washington University Department of Music; the Navy Center for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory; and the University of Maryland Institute of Advanced Computer Studies. The venue for the conference is the Jack Morton Auditorium in the Media and Public Affairs Building on the George Washington University campus.

We would like to invite the global ICAD community to accentuate this perspective in their work, and authors are especially encouraged to consider how they can incorporate auditory display into the presentation of their papers, for instance, by including auditory annotations and examples of the sounds used in their efforts and/or by sonifying their results. Just as it would be unusual for presentations of papers on graphics not to include some visual artefacts, we are aiming for it to be the norm that ICAD paper presentations employ sound in addition to the voice of the speaker. Additionally, we hope this theme will resonate in this yearÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s concert and sonification submissions and inspire new perspectives for interactive, real-time performances.

July 16, 2010
Uppsala, Sweden

http://stp.lingfil.uu.se/atanlp/

1. Workshop Description

The theory of tree automata has an increasing number of applications in natural language processing; examples for this can be found in work on topics as diverse as grammar formalisms, computational semantics, language generation, and machine translation. Here, the term tree automaton is to be understood in a generic sense, including all types of formal devices that specify, generate or transform tree languages or, more generally, tree series.

The goals of this workshop are to provide a dedicated venue for the presentation of work that relates the theory of tree automata to natural language processing, and to create a forum where researchers from the two areas can meet and exchange ideas. Specifically, the workshop aims at raising the awareness for theoretical results useful for applications in natural language processing, and at identifying open theoretical problems raised by such applications.

2. Topics of Interest

Topics of interest for the workshop are all topics related to or motivated by the application of tree automata in natural language processing. These include but are not limited to the following:

* representations of languages by tree automata and tree grammars;
* tree transducers, synchronous grammars, and related devices and their application to, e.g., machine translation;
* tree logics and their application to, e.g., natural language syntax and semantics;
* weighted extensions of the aforementioned;
* algorithms related to the implementation of tree automata, such as algorithms for matching, accepting, and parsing;
* learning and training algorithms for tree automata;
* tree automata-based query languages for, e.g., treebanks and parallel syntactic corpora;
* relations between tree languages and string languages with motivation in NLP;
* case studies concerning the application of tree automata techniques in natural language processing.

4. Submission Information

The workshop invites submission of two kinds of contributions: full papers and proposals for so-called quickfire presentations.

4.1 Full Papers

Full papers should report original and unpublished research on topics of interest for the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop, and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results. A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be presented or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings. If essentially identical papers are submitted to other conferences or workshops as well, this fact must be indicated at submission.

Reviewing will be double-blind, and all papers will receive at least three independent reviews. Submissions will be assessed with respect to appropriateness, clarity, soundness/correctness, meaningful comparison, originality/innovativeness, and impact of ideas or results.

The maximum length of a submitted paper is eight (8) pages of content, excluding references. If necessary, authors may add an appendix containing proofs and the like, but the paper should be accessible without reading the appendix. The final manuscript is limited to eight (8) pages of content and nine (9) pages in total.

As reviewing will be double-blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, anonymous citations and acknowledgements should be avoided.

4.2 Proposals for Quickfire Presentations

Individual researchers and research groups working on topics of interest for the workshop are invited to present their work to the workshop audience in the form of a so-called quickfire presentation of about 10 min each. The idea behind these presentations is to provide a means for triggering discussions and an exchange of ideas. Based on the interests of a research group or an individual researcher, the typical quickfire presentation will point out potential relations between the theory of tree automata and natural language processing, thus indicating ideas and opportunities for future collaboration rather than presenting specific results obtained. In particular, we welcome quickfire presentations by researchers in natural language processing who wish to enter into a scientific discussion with researchers in tree automata theory, or vice versa.

Quickfire presentations will be selected based on informal proposals that briefly describe the planned content of the presentation and indicate why it is supposed to be of interest for the other attendees of the workshop. The maximum length of a submitted proposal is one (1) page. Proposals for quickfire presentations related to submitted full papers should carefully point out the difference between the two.

4.3 General Information

All submissions must be electronic in PDF and must be formatted using the ACL 2010 style files, which are available at the following address:

http://www.acl2010.org/authors.html

Contributions should be submitted via the submission site:

        The Fourth Linguistic Annotation Workshop (LAW IV)

                              Uppsala, Sweden
                              15-16 July 2010
              http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~clp/LAW4

Linguistic annotation of natural language corpora is the backbone of supervised methods for statistical natural language processing. The Fourth LAW will provide a forum for presentation and discussion of innovative research on all aspects of linguistic annotation, including the creation/evaluation of annotation schemes, methods for automatic and manual annotation, use and evaluation of annotation software and frameworks, representation of linguistic data and annotations, etc. As in the past, the LAW will serve as a venue for annotation researchers to work towards standardization, best practices, and interoperability of annotation information and software. Specifically,
the goals of this workshop include:

(1) The exchange and propagation of research results with respect to
the annotation, manipulation and exploitation of corpora, taking into
account different applications and theoretical investigations in the
field of language technology and research;

(2) Working towards the harmonization and interoperability from the
perspective of the increasingly large number of tools and frameworks
that support the creation, instantiation, manipulation, querying, and
exploitation of annotated resources;

(3) Pushing the frontier of linguistic annotation and of human language technology by extending the range of linguistic phenomena for which reliable annotation techniques exist.
(4)  Working towards a consensus on all issues crucial to the
advancement of the field of corpus annotation.

We invite submissions of long papers and posters, and demonstrations relating to any aspect of the linguistic annotation. Long papers should reflect work in an advanced state, but posters may describe more preliminary work and pilot studies. Posters and proposals for a system demonstration are to be submitted in the form of a short paper. A demonstration proposal should provide an overview of the system to be demonstrated, including functionality, supported input/output formats or structures, supported languages and modalities, etc. Accepted proposals will also appear in the proceedings and are intended to provide background for the demonstration. Papers are invited to address issues in all aspects of linguistic annotation, including but not limited to:

Overview

Cloud Computing has attracted a great deal of attention both from the research community and from industry. The Cloud Computing paradigm has evolved over the years from a basic IT infrastructure (data centers) to platform as a service (PaaS), and then from software as a service (SaaS) to complete service enablement on a hosted infrastructure (IaaS). At the same time, virtualization has emerged as a key enabler for the cloud computing paradigm. Several challenges arise in the design, implementation, and deployment of virtualized clouds. These challenges include but are not limited to automated service provisioning, service monitoring and management, resource elasticity, cloud programming models, economic models, charging and accounting, and, finally, virtualization-specific issues such as image management and virtual appliance-based service creation.

We believe that this emerging field will benefit from close interaction between researchers and industry practitioners, so that the research can inform current deployments and deployment challenges can inform new research directions. To foster such an experience, HotCloud will provide a forum for academics as well as practitioners in the field to share their experience, leverage each other's perspectives, and identify new/emerging ""hot"" trends in this area. We solicit six-page original/position/work-in-progress/experience papers on a broad range of topics that address fundamental issues in the enablement of applications, services, and infrastructures in a large-scale, virtualized cloud platform that includes deployment, monitoring, and management to address the issues of scale, reliability, root-cause analysis, dynamic resource planning, security and privacy, and new applications. We encourage the submission of position papers describing novel research directions, as well as those by leading researchers and industry experts describing practical experiences in these areas.

Description
Scientific workflows have become an increasingly popular paradigm for scientists to 
formalize and structure complex scientific processes to enable and accelerate many 
significant scientific discoveries. A scientific workflow is a formal specification 
of a scientific process, which represents, streamlines, and automates the analytical 
and computational steps that a scientist needs to go through from dataset selection 
and integration, computation and analysis, to final data product presentation and 
visualization. The importance of scientific workflows has been recognized by NSF 
since 2006 and was reemphasized recently in a science article 
titled ""Beyond the Data Deluge"" (Science, Vol. 323. no. 5919, pp. 1297 ?C 1298, 2009), 
which concluded, ??In the future, the rapidity with which any given discipline advances 
is likely to depend on how well the community acquires the necessary expertise in database, 
workflow management, visualization, and cloud computing technologies.""

The goal of SWF 2010 is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to present 
their recent research results and best practices of scientific workflows, and identify 
the emerging trends, opportunities, problems, and challenges in this area. 
Authors are invited to submit regular papers (8 pages) and short papers (4 pages) 
that show original unpublished research results in all areas 
of scientific workflows. Topics of interest are listed below; however, submissions 
on all aspects of scientific workflows are welcome. 
Accepted SWF 2010 papers will be included in the proceedings of IEEE SERVICES 2010, 
which will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press.


Topics
o Scientific workflow provenance management and analytics
o Scientific workflow data, metadata, service, and task management
o Scientific workflow architectures, models, and languages
o Scientific workflow monitoring, debugging, and failure handling
o Streaming data processing in scientific workflows
o Pipelined, data, workflow, and task parallelism in scientific workflows
o Service, Grid, or Cloud-based scientific workflows
o Data, metadata, compute, user-interaction, or visualization-intensive scientific workflows
o Scientific workflow composition
o Security issues in scientific workflows 
o Data integration and service integration in scientific workflows
o Scientific workflow mapping, optimization, and scheduling
o Scientific workflow modeling, simulation, analysis, and verification
o Scalability, reliability, extensibility, agility, and interoperability    
o Scientific workflow applications

Background and Goals
===============
The ""Recent Trends in Aspect based Information Systems"" (RTABISÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢10) is a
new Workshop joint to ICSOFT 2010. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
complements Object Oriented (OO) programming by allowing the developer
to dynamically modify the static OO model to create a system that can
grow to meet new requirements. Just as objects in the real world can
change their states during their lifecycles, an application can adopt
new characteristics as it develops. AOP complements object-oriented
programming by facilitating another type of modularity that pulls
together the widespread implementation of a crosscutting concern into a
single unit. These units are termed aspects, hence the name
aspect-oriented programming. By compartmentalizing aspect code,
crosscutting concerns become easy to deal with. Aspects of a system can
be changed, inserted or removed at compile time, and even reused. So,
Aspect Oriented Software Development gathers a set of techniques for
modular definition and the implementation of transverse functions for
enterprises applications. Typical crosscutting concerns include logging,
context-sensitive error handling, performance optimization, and design
patterns.

AOP is becoming an industrial reality with projects and commercial
offers. Moreover, related topics are numerous.

This first workshop on Recent Trends in Aspect based Information Systems
provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to present results,
applications, and experiences in software based on Aspects. The
organizing committee welcomes high quality contributions that describe
original and unpublished works in the field of aspect-based application
engineering in terms of design, development, testing, and deployment.

            PAPER SUBMISSION DEADLINE FOR WORKSHOP: March 25, 2010


Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO), i.e., the simultaneous
optimization of 2 or more objective functions by means of bio-inspired
search heuristics, has become one of the main research fields in
evolutionary computation in recent years and as such also gained interest
from the classical field of multicriteria decision making (MCDM). Together
with its fast development in practice, also theoretical analyses of EMO
gained more and more interest.

To foster this growing interest of theory in EMO, the workshop
""Theoretical Aspects of Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization"" aims at
bringing together theoreticians both working in the field of EMO and from
single-objective optimization as well as EMO practitioners. Besides
presenting the newest theoretical results about EMO, the workshop aims at
identifying a broad list of challenging questions to be tackled in the
near future for which we explicitly invite both theoreticians and
practitioners. The workshop covers all theoretical topics of EMO,
including but not limited to
- convergence analysis
- decision making
- diversity mechanisms
- experimental studies based on theoretical considerations
- hybridized EMO approaches
- indicator-based search
- many-objective optimization
- multiobjectivization
- performance assessment
- preference handling
- runtime analyses (incl. approximation results)
- set-based EMO
- variation operators specific to the multiobjective case

We invite submissions as proposals for a talk in form of a short abstract
of maximally 4 pages in ACM format. The talks should present recent
research ideas and identify open theoretical questions to foster
discussions rather than showing finalized results. Accepted abstracts will
be published in a separate workshop proceedings associated to the GECCO
conference which also appears in the ACM Digital Library.

Over the last ten years, the way in which education and training is delivered has changed considerably with the advent of new technologies. One such new technology that holds considerable promise for helping to engage learners is Games-Based Learning (GBL). The Conference offers an opportunity for scholars and practitioners interested in the issues related to GBL to share their thinking and research findings. Papers can cover various issues and aspects of GBL in education and training: technology and implementation issues associated with the development of GBL; use of mobile and MMOGs for learning; pedagogical issues associated with GBL; social and ethical issues in GBL; GBL best cases and practices, and other related aspects. We are particularly interested in empirical research that addresses whether GBL enhances learning. This Conference provides a forum for discussion, collaboration and intellectual exchange for all those interested in any of these fields of research or practice. 

The conference committee welcomes both academic and practitioner papers on a wide range of topics using a range of scholarly approaches including theoretical and empirical papers employing qualitative, quantitative and critical methods.  Action research, case studies and work in progress/posters are welcomed approaches. PhD Research, proposals for roundtable discussions, non-academic contributions and product demonstrations based on the main themes are also invited.

Important information

The selection panel of the conference committee will consider all abstracts received by the submission deadline to ensure that the proposed paper is relevant to the Conference.  
The authors of abstracts that describe a relevant paper will receive a notification of abstract selection. 
All full papers will be double-blind reviewed by members of the conference committee to ensure an adequate standard, that the proposed subject of their abstract has been followed, that the paper is of a suitable length, the standard of English is adequate and the paper is appropriately referenced. 
For authors whose first language is not English we request that you have your work proof read prior to submission by a native English speaker (or at least a fluent English speaker). Papers can be rejected due to a poor standard of English. 
Papers that are accepted will be published in the conference proceedings providing at least one author registers and presents the work at the Conference (see the registration section of the conference website for more information about registration). 
Due to the large number of papers expected for this conference, the committee only allows an author to present one paper. Therefore if multiple papers are accepted for presentation different co-authors need to present each paper. Author registrations must be completed by 16 September 2010.

                           CALL FOR PAPERS


As part of ""The International Conference on High Performance Computing &
Simulation - HPCS 2010""
(http://cisedu.us/cis/hpcs/10/main/callForPapers.jsp)
In conjunction with ""The 6th International Wireless Communications and
Mobile Computing Conference - IWCMC 2010
                       June 28 - July 2, 2010
                       Caen, Normandy, France

           ****  EXTENTED SUBMISSION DEADLINE: FEBRUARY 28, 2010 ****


SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
Providing high performance computing and security is a challenging task.
Internet, operating systems and distributed environments currently
suffer from poor security support and cannot resist common attacks.
Adding security measures typically degrade performance. This workshop
addresses relationships between security and high performance computing
systems in three directions. First, it considers how to add security
properties (authentication, confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation,
access control) to high performance computing systems. In this case,
safety properties can also be addressed, such as availability and fault
tolerance for high performance computing systems.  Second, it covers how
to use high performance computing systems to solve security problems.
For instance, a grid computation can break an encryption code, or a
cluster can support high performance intrusion detection.
More generally, this topic addresses every efficient use of a high
performance computing systems to improve security. Third, it
investigates the tradeoffs between maintaining high performance and
achieving security in computing systems and solutions to balance the two
objectives.  In all these directions, various performance analyses or
monitoring techniques can be conducted to show the efficiency of a
security infrastructure.

The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting
novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of computer and
network security, as well as case studies and implementation experiences.
Papers should have practical relevance to the construction, evaluation,
application, or operation of secure systems.

Overview
Wireless ad hoc networks have attracted the attention of the research 
community in the last several years. Now, that some of the fundamental 
issues and challenges have been clearly assessed, the focus is partially 
shifting to new issues, which include application scenarios (road 
safety, disaster recovery, sensors and actuators, etc.), autonomous 
organization and operation, optimization and control, and service 
creation and support. Moreover, new and exciting challenges are posed by 
closely related networks such as wireless mesh networks, sensor 
networks, and vehicular networks.
Med-Hoc-Net is a major annual international workshop, aiming to serve as 
a platform for researchers and visionaries from academia, research labs, 
and industry. Following Sicily (2006), Corfu (2007),  Palma de Mallorca

CALL FOR PAPERS: 6th ECMFA Traceability Workshop (ECMFA-TW 2010)
                                                          Paris, France
                                                        June 15th 2010

******************************************************

Traceability is an important theoretical and practical challenge in
Model Based Engineering (MBE).
Traceability mechanisms are needed in processes involving automatic
model to model transformations, in
text/code generation, and in manual modelling activities, as well as in
end-to-end traceability scenarios.
We are facing challenges of keeping models consistently synchronized,
models and text/code in consistent
states, and mixing manual updates with automatic processes.

The two first ECMDA Traceability workshops focused mainly on theoretical
and technical aspects of
traceability, and concluded that many of the theoretical and technical
challenges of traceability are well
understood. As a result, the workshop focus was shifted more towards
applications of traceability in
industrial settings.

There are still unsolved theoretical and technical issues of
traceability. However, still the most important
limitation is the availability of tools to support full traceability and
proofs of real usage of
traceability in MBE.

Therefore, we especially invite papers presenting practical solutions
that address traceability issues, as
well as papers that present traceability tool solutions. We also seek
papers that address how and when
traceability information should be added, how it should be kept
up-to-date, and how, when and for what
purposes it can be used. These and other issues of traceability in MBE
that have a strong practical focus
are all good topics for papers submitted to the workshop.


 - Tools supporting traceability of model and code artifacts
 - Industrial case studies
 - Practical applications and experience with traceability
 - How, when and for what purposes traceability information should/can
be added
 - Novel theoretical and technical approaches to handle model-based
traceabilty

 Other topics on traceability in model-based development are also welcomed.

DSN 2010: 1st International Workshop on Fault-Tolerance for HPC at Extreme Scale
		Chicago, Illinois, USA
                                June 28 2010 - July 1 2010


Objectives and Challenges
With the emergence of many-core processors, accelerators, and alternative/heterogeneous
architectures, the HPC community faces a new challenge: a scaling in number of processing
elements that supersedes the historical trend of scaling in processor frequencies. The attendant
increase in system complexity has first-order implications for fault tolerance. Mounting evidence
invalidates traditional assumptions of HPC fault tolerance: faults are increasingly multiple-point
instead of single-point and interdependent instead of independent; silent failures and silent data
corruption are no longer rare enough to discount; stabilization time consumes a larger fraction
of useful system lifetime, with failure rates projected to exceed one per hour on the largest
systems; and application interrupt rates are apparently diverging from system failure rates.
The workshop will convene a diverse group of experts in HPC and fault-tolerance to inaugurate a
fault-tolerance research agenda for responding to the unique challenges that extreme scale and
complexity. Innovation is encouraged and discussion of non-traditional approaches is welcome.

KEYNOTE SPEAKER

We are honoured to welcome Anind Dey (Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University) to the WIVE'10 workshop for an invited talk.

SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP

Internet is a medium allowing services and information exchange in an open and decentralized environment, notably with numerous applications for virtual enterprises. It concerns enterprise information systems, local, regional and governmental organizations but it also involves more and more common users in the so-called web 2.0. The main stake is to use Internet as a technological support to communication, information exchange, service composition personalisation and access by all and anywhere. In this perspective, some work has been done these last years to combine classical techniques of information management with artificial intelligence technologies thus creating a new research domain called Web Intelligence. Research in Web Intelligence contributes to the development of algorithms, models and tools to handle the social and economic impact of the web usages.

The workshop will provide presentation and discussion opportunities for researchers working on web intelligence applied to collaborative networks, such as virtual enterprises and organizations. The possibilities and consequences of the web usage for collaborative networks are tremendous and new tools are required to satisfy users and service providers. Thus, Web Intelligence brings new research problems related to information and service access, quality of service, personalization, privacy preserving, trust as well as other issues.

The workshop Web Intelligence and Virtual Enterprises (VE) expects contributions on topics such as:

Multi-agent models and tools for VE
Services and Grid Services for VE, Service oriented architectures
Web information mining, filtering and retrieval within/for VE
Web-based applications and plate-forms for VE
Intelligent web interaction, querying, diffusion
Semantics and ontology engineering for VE
Self-* models and techniques for VE
Social networks modelling, virtual communities, social intelligence
Context-based approach, profile management, personalization and recommendations for/through VE
Privacy preserving, security, trust-based computing & reputation systems
Applications: E-* (market, procurement, technologies, health, government, etc.) and VE
VE and content and knowledge repositories, behaviour modelling and exchange
Web intelligence, mobility and VE, Ambient Intelligence, Pervasive computing
Performances evaluation, experiments, user feed-back
Surveys on WI and VE
The organization of the Web Intelligence & Virtual Enterprises workshop at PRO-VE'10 is supported by the Web Intelligence project from the French RhÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ´ne-Alpes regional cluster ISLE.

SUBMISSIONS

The Web Intelligence and Virtual Enterprises workshop welcomes the submission of theoretical, experimental, methodological as well as application papers. Papers may report on completed work, descriptions of work in progress or discussion papers.

Submitted papers will undergo a thorough review process. Papers will be published into the CD-Rom of the conference. In addition, a selection of the workshop papers will be published as post-proceedings in a special issue of the International Journal of Web Intelligence and Agent Systems (http://www.iospress.nl/loadtop/load.php?isbn=15701263).

  Second International Workshop on Security in Model Driven Architecture
Paris, France
Conference to be held: 16th June 2010

Software security and reliability is rapidly becoming one of the most pressing issues in software engineering since software has become a critical component in almost all systems that society relies on. The level of risk the society faces from intentional or unintentional failures in these systems has increased in an almost uncontrolled fashion:

    * With software controlling, protecting, and affecting more and more critical information and systems, the consequences of failure has increased significantly.
    * As software becomes more complex, it tends to contain more flaws, and as it becomes more networked, its exposure to potential adversaries increases.
    * Software-intensive systems are increasingly becoming viable financial and political targets for well-funded and well-motivated attackers, thus increasing the overall hreat to these systems.

Today, security is often an afterthought when developing software, rarely included in the early phases of software development, and mostly focused on detecting problems, rather than on preventing them in the first place.
Despite a rash of new programming paradigms, methodologies, and development environments, the ever increasing number of vulnerabilities found in software clearly shows that a different approach is called for.
Software developers use models extensively, particularly in the early phases of software development, in order to improve software quality.

Important dates

Submission deadline: April 2nd, 2010

As software engineering is requested to answer dynamic, automated, adaptive, optimal and/or large-scale demands, other computer science disciplines come to play. Artificial Intelligence is one of them that may bring software engineering into further height. Conversely, software engineering techniques also play an important role to alleviate development cost and time of AI techniques as well as assist in introducing new AI techniques. Such mutually beneficial characteristics have appeared in the past few decades and still evolved due to new challenges.

The objective of the special track on Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering is to provide a forum for researchers and industry practitioners to exchange and discuss latest innovative ""synergistic"" AI and software engineering techniques/practices. Namely, we are interested in AI solutions to software engineering challenges, software engineering practices to answer AI obstacles, and techniques that could benefit these realms bi-directionally.

This special track seeks high-quality original and unpublished papers in the following topics including but not limited to these topics:

* AI techniques for optimization, transformation, and configuration management 
* AI techniques for software reuse, evolution, maintenance and refactoring 
* AI techniques for ontology and other semantic aspects in software engineering 
* AI techniques for business process management and business rules 
* AI techniques for reverse engineering and program understanding 
* AI techniques for aspect mining and pattern mining 
* AI techniques for testing and quality assurance 
* AI techniques for performance engineering (e.g., performance approximation, monitoring, and adaptation) 
* AI techniques for software specification, design, integration and requirement engineering 
* AI techniques for software analysis and validation 
* AI techniques for cost analysis and risk assessment in software projects 
* Agent-based software engineering 
* Visual modeling and model-driven development for AI techniques

The Fourth International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies
Florence, Italy
25 - 30 October 2010


The rapid advances in ubiquitous technologies make fruition of more than 35 years of research in distributed computing systems, and more than two decades of mobile computing. The ubiquity vision is becoming a reality. Hardware and software components evolved to deliver functionality under failure-prone environments with limited resources. The advent of web services and the progress on wearable devices, ambient components, user-generated content, mobile communications, and new business models generated new applications and services. The conference makes a bridge between issues with software and hardware challenges through mobile communications.   

The goal of the International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies, UBICOMM 2010, is to bring together researchers from the academia and practitioners from the industry in order to address fundamentals of ubiquitous systems and the new applications related to them. The conference will provide a forum where researchers shall be able to present recent research results and new research problems and directions related to them. The conference seeks contributions presenting novel research in all aspects of ubiquitous techniques and technologies applied to advanced mobile applications.

Advances in web services technologies along with their integration into mobility, online and new business models provide a technical infrastructure that enables the progress of mobile services and applications. These include dynamic and on-demand service, context-aware services, and mobile web services. While driving new business models and new online services, particular techniques must be developed for web service composition, web service-driven system design methodology, creation of web services, and on-demand web services.

As mobile and ubiquitous computing becomes a reality, more formal and informal learning will take pace out of the confines of the traditional classroom.  Two trends converge to make this possible; increasingly powerful cell phones and PDAs, and improved access to wireless broadband. At the same time, due to the increasing complexity, modern learners will need tools that operate in an intuitive manner and are flexibly integrated in the surrounding learning environment.

Educational services will become more customized and personalized, and more frequently subjected to changes.  Learning and teaching are now becoming less tied to physical locations, co-located members of a group, and co-presence in time.  Learning and teaching increasingly take place in fluid combinations of virtual and ""real"" contexts, and fluid combinations of presence in time, space and participation in community.  To the learner full access and abundance in communicative opportunities and information retrieval represents new challenges and affordances.

Consequently, the educational challenges are numerous in the intersection of technology development, curriculum development, content development and educational infrastructure.

In this workshop we solicit research and industrial contributions covering developments that operate in the intersection of mobile and ubiquitous technologies on the one hand, and educational settings in open, distance and corporate learning on the other, including learning theories, applications, and systems.  

The topics suggested by the conference can be discussed in term of concepts, state of the art, research, standards, implementations, running experiments, applications, and industrial case studies. Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, which are not under review in any other conference or journal in the following, but not limited to, topic areas.  All tracks are open to both research and industry contributions.

Supplemental Material and Formatting Guidelines

Papers can be up to a maximum of ten (10) pages in length, with the caveat that an optional tenth page can only contain references. Note that, although we have increased the upper limit for page length, this does not mean all submitted papers should be exactly 10 pages. In general, please try to make sure that your paper length is commensurate with its stated contribution.

Papers can include full-color figures throughout. We encourage the use of digital video to enhance the submission (which could be embedded directly into the pdf version of the paper), particularly if part or all of the work addresses interactive techniques. Submission of code or other supplemental material in order to increase the reproducibility of the work is also encouraged. Those submitting to the conference are urged to make available salient parameter settings of pertinent algorithms and ideally obtain results using open source data. In case specific data sets are employed, we ask that a version of these be made available where possible. We also encourage the placement of a teaser image on the very first page to showcase your work.

Please take note that this year's review process will be optionally double-blind for those who want to submit their work anonymously (double-blind means that no one, other than the IPC members will know the identity of the authors). When submitting for double-blind reviewing you are asked NOT to include any identifying information. If you do not want to anonymize your submission you are free to leave your name and affiliation on the first page. In that case the review process will be single-blind, i.e. the reviewers know the identity of the authors, but the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers.

Details and guidelines for preparing a proper submission can be found at http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~vis/Tasks/camera_tvcg.html. Guidelines for supplementary materials may be found at

http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~vis/Tasks/supplement_tvcg.html.

Authors must follow the style guidelines specified therein.
Journal Publication and Date of Publication

All papers accepted to IEEE InfoVis and IEEE Vis will appear in a special issue (Nov/Dec 2010) of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). This special issue will be published before the conference, the publication date being October 16th. Papers (including supplemental material) will undergo a revision and review cycle after initial notification of review results in order to ensure that they are acceptable for publication and presentation in the journal. The paper and supplemental material will also appear in the IEEE Digital Library.
Submission Criteria and Review Process

IEEE Infovis and IEEE Vis will now accommodate a double-blind review process for those authors that want to submit their work anonymously. Therefore, those authors should NOT include their name or institution on the cover page of the initial submission, and should make an effort to ensure that there is no revealing information in the text (such as obvious citations to authors' previous work, or making acknowledgments to colleagues of long standing). Authors should also avoid posting their submitted manuscript on the web until the final notification date. To reiterate, the choice of complete anonymity is optional. Authors can reveal their names and affiliations in the first round of the review cycle if they choose not to anonymize their work.

Note that submission of an abstract for each paper is mandatory by March 21, 2010 and full papers are due March 31st, 2010. All submissions must be original works that have not been published previously in any archived conference proceedings, magazine, or journal. Related previous work by the authors must be cited (anonymously if desired and appropriate), and the differences to work described in the submitted manuscript must be clearly explained. Concurrent submissions are strictly forbidden. If it is determined that an identical or substantially similar manuscript is simultaneously under consideration at another publication venue or forum (e.g., conference, journal, edited book) the manuscript will be rejected at an early stage in the review process.

A paper is considered published if it has appeared in a peer-reviewed archived journal or in published meeting proceedings that are commercially available afterward to non-attendees in the form of archives (including digital). There are exceptions. It should be duly noted that work described in the Interactive Posters, Contest Entries, or Late-Breaking Hot Topics venues from previous Visweek conferences is thus not considered formally published, and may be resubmitted provided it has substantial additional new material.
General Expectations (Ethics Guidelines)

At least one author of an accepted paper must attend the conference to present the work, and authors will also be required to present a very brief summary of their talk at the opening papers preview session.

Since accepted submissions will appear in the premier archival journal of the field (IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics), we expect that the submissions will clearly discuss the novel and significant contributions and place them in the context of prior art in the field. This will involve highlighting how the current contributions differ from and advance the state-of-the-art in visualization, especially, but not limited to previous work published in the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) and other leading journals and conferences including IEEE InfoVis, IEEE Visualization, ACM SIGGRAPH, CHI, UIST, EuroVis, and PacificVis.

When submitting your paper you will be asked to provide a complete list of authors even when submitting an anonymized version of the manuscript. This is required to avoid potential conflicts of interest when assigning reviewers. Adding additional authors AFTER the acceptance of a paper is unacceptable and will not be permitted.

Submissions will be treated as confidential communications during the review process, so submission does not constitute public disclosure of any ideas therein. Submissions should contain no information or materials that will be proprietary or confidential at the time of publication (at the conference), and should cite no publications that are proprietary or confidential at the time of publication.

Our conference will adhere to the VGTC ethics guidelines for reviewers that can be found at http://vgtc.org/wpmu/techcom/conferences/ethics-guidelines/.

Submission

This year we are using the Precision Conference System (PCS) to handle the submission and reviewing process. Electronic submissions details can be found at https://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/.
Paper Types

An information visualization paper typically falls into one of five categories: technique, system, design study, evaluation, or model. We briefly discuss these categories below. Although your main paper type has to be specified during the paper submission process, papers can include elements of more than one of these categories. Please see ""Process and Pitfalls in Writing Information Visualization Research Papers"" by Tamara Munzner for more detailed discussion on how to write a successful information visualization paper.

Technique papers introduce novel techniques or algorithms that have not previously appeared in the literature, or that significantly extend known techniques or algorithms, for example by scaling to datasets of much larger size than before or by generalizing a technique to a larger class of uses.

The technique or algorithm description provided in the paper should be complete enough that a competent graduate student in visualization could implement the work, and the authors should create a prototype implementation of the methods. Relevant previous work must be referenced, and the advantage of the new methods over it should be clearly demonstrated. There should be a discussion of the tasks and datasets for which this new method is appropriate, and its limitations. Evaluation through informal or formal user studies, or other methods, will often serve to strengthen the paper, but are not mandatory.

System papers present a blend of algorithms, technical requirements, user requirements, and design that solves a major problem. The system that is described is both novel and important, and has been implemented. The rationale for significant design decisions is provided, and the system is compared to documented, best-of-breed systems already in use. The comparison includes specific discussion of how the described system differs from and is, in some significant respects, superior to those systems. For example, the described system may offer substantial advancements in the performance or usability of visualization systems, or novel capabilities. Every effort should be made to eliminate external factors (such as advances in processor performance, memory sizes or operating system features) that would affect this comparison. For further suggestions, please review ""How (and How Not) to Write a Good Systems Paper"" by Roy Levin and David Redell, and ""Empirical Methods in CS and AI"" by Toby Walsh.

Application / Design Study papers explore the choices made when applying visualization techniques in an application area, for example relating the visual encodings and interaction techniques to the requirements of the target task. Similarly, Application papers have been the norm when researchers describe the use of visualization techniques to glean insights from problems in engineering and science. Although a significant amount of application domain background information can be useful to provide a framing context in which to discuss the specifics of the target task, the primary focus of the case study must be the visualization content. The results of the Application / Design Study, including insights generated in the application domain, should be clearly conveyed. Describing new techniques and algorithms developed to solve the target problem will strengthen a design study paper, but the requirements for novelty are less stringent than in a Technique paper. Where necessary, the identification of the underlying parametric space and its efficient search must be aptly described. The work will be judged by the design lessons learned or insights gleaned, on which future contributors can build. We invite submissions on any application area.

Evaluation papers explore the usage of visualization by human users, and typically present an empirical study of visualization techniques or systems. Authors are not necessarily expected to implement the systems used in these studies themselves; the research contribution will be judged on the validity and importance of the experimental results as opposed to the novelty of the systems or techniques under study. The conference committee appreciates the difficulty and importance of designing and performing rigorous experiments, including the definition of appropriate hypotheses, tasks, data sets, selection of subjects, measurement, validation and conclusions. The goal of such efforts should be to move from mere description of experiments, toward prediction and explanation. We do suggest that potential authors who have not had formal training in the design of experiments involving human subjects may wish to partner with a colleague from an area such as psychology or human-computer interaction who has experience with designing rigorous experimental protocols and statistical analysis of the resulting data. Other novel forms of evaluation are also encouraged.

Theory/Model papers present new interpretations of the foundational theory of visualization. Implementations are usually not relevant for papers in this category. Papers should focus on basic advancement in our understanding of how visualization techniques complement and exploit properties of human vision and cognition.

The 3rd Workshop on Cyber Security Experimentation and Test
Washington D.C, U.S.A 
Conference to be held 9th August 2010

Overview

Effective cyber security experimentation on network testbeds is challenging for a number of reasons:

    * Scale: Experiments may need to be quite large and complex to accurately portray the phenomenon being investigated.
    * Multi-party nature: Interesting experiments include humans, drawn from several logical or physical parties, who either collaborate or compete with each other.
    * Risk: Cyber security experiments naturally carry significant risk if not properly contained and controlled. At the same time, these experiments may well require some degree of interaction with the larger world to be useful.
    * Realism: Experiments must faithfully recreate the relevant features of the phenomena they investigate in order to obtain correct results, yet data about threats and the Internet landscape is sparse and often must undergo transformations to reduce scale and sensitivity before being ported to testbeds. Hence careful reasoning about ""realism"" is required.
    * Rigor: Repeatability and correctness must be ensured in any scientific experimentation. These are extremely hard to achieve on distributed network testbeds, due to testbed dynamics, sharing and unpredictability, and experimentation scale and complexity that overwhelm humans.
    * Setup/scenario complexity: Testbed experiments are very complex and evolve over time. Time investment needed for setup and manipulation of experiments that are realistic, correct, and repeatable is too large for a single user and requires community involvement. Tools and practices for sharing experiments and their components are lacking.

Meeting these challenges requires both transformational advance in capability and transformational advance in usability of the underlying research infrastructure. The 3rd Workshop on Cyber Security Experimentation and Test (CSET '10) invites submissions on the science, design, architecture, construction, operation, and use of cyber security experiments in network testbeds and infrastructures. While we are particularly interested in works that relate to emulation testbeds, we invite all work relevant to cyber security experimentation and evaluation (e.g., simulation, deployment, traffic models).

Topics

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

    * Science of security/testbed experimentation
          o Data and tools to achieve realistic experiment setup/scenarios
          o Diagnosis of and methodologies for dealing with experimental artifacts
          o Support for experimentation on a large scale (virtualization, federation, high fidelity scale-down)
          o Tools and methodologies to achieve, and metrics to measure, correctness, repeatability, and sharing of experiments
    * Testbeds and methodologies
          o Tools, methodologies, and infrastructure that support risky experimentation
          o Support for experimentation in emerging security topics (cyber-physical systems, wireless, botnets, etc.)
          o Novel experimentation approaches (e.g., coupling of emulation and simulation)
          o Experience in designing or deploying secure testbeds
          o Instrumentation and automation of experiments; their archiving, preservation, and visualization
          o Fair sharing of testbed resources
    * Hands-on security education
          o Experiences teaching security classes that use hands-on security experiments for homework, in-class demonstrations, or class projects
          o Experiences from red team/blue team exercises

Submissions

Research submissions must have a separate section labeled ""Methodology"" in which they clearly identify their research hypothesis and tests designed to prove/disprove it. Submissions that recount experiences (e.g., from education or testbed deployment) must have a separate section labeled ""Lessons Learned"" where they draw conclusions from their experience and generalize it to other environments.

12th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery
Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain
August 30 2010

Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery has been widely accepted as a key technology for enterprises and organisations to improve their abilities in data analysis, decision support, and the automatic extraction of knowledge from data. With the exponentially growing amount of information to be included in the decision making process, the data to be considered becomes more and more complex in both structure and semantics. New developments such as cloud computing add to the challenges with massive scaling, a new computing infrastructure, and new types of data. Consequently, the process of retrieval and knowledge discovery from this huge amount of heterogeneous complex data builds the litmus-test for the research in the area.

During the past years, the International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK) has become one of the most important international scientific events to bring together researchers, developers and practitioners to discuss latest research issues and experiences in developing and deploying data warehousing and knowledge discovery systems, applications, and solutions. This yearÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s conference (DaWaK 2010), builds on this tradition of facilitating the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas, experience and potential research directions. DaWaK 2010 seeks to introduce innovative principles, methods, algorithms and solutions to challenging problems faced in the development of data warehousing, knowledge discovery, data mining applications, and the emerging area of ""cloud intelligence"". Submissions presenting current research work on both theoretical and practical aspects of data warehousing and knowledge discovery are encouraged. Particularly, we strongly welcome submissions dealing with emerging real world applications such as real-time data warehousing, analysis of spatial and spatiotemporal data, OLAP mining, mobile OLAP, and mining science data (e.g. bioinformatics, geophysics).

2010 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference

Please join us for the 2010 International Waveform Diversity & Design Conference in beautiful Niagara Falls, Canada. This fifth conference in the on-going series will continue to build on the success of the previous four conferences by bringing together researchers from numerous diverse backgrounds and specialties to facilitate the exchange and cross-fertilization of ideas and research. Recent advances in hardware technology are enabling a much wider range of design freedoms to be explored for sensor and communication systems. As a result, there are emerging and compelling changes in system requirements such as more efficient spectrum usage, higher sensitivities, transmitter/receiver agility, greater information content, improved robustness to errors, etc. The combination of these is fueling a worldwide interest in the subject of waveform design and the use of waveform diversity techniques. The organizers of this conference are particularly interested in seeing the results of experimentally collected data.

For authors whose first language is not English we request that you have your work proof read prior to submission by a native English speaker (or at least a fluent English speaker). Papers can be rejected due to a poor standard of English. 
Papers that are accepted will be published in the conference proceedings providing at least one author registers and presents the work at the Conference (see the registration section of the conference website for more information about registration). 
Due to the large number of papers expected for this conference, the committee only allows an author to present one paper. Therefore if multiple papers are accepted for presentation different co-authors need to present each paper. 
 
 
Publication opportunity

Papers accepted for the conference will be published in the conference proceedings, subject to author registration. Selected papers from the Conference will be considered for publication in a special issue of the Electronic Journal of e-Learning. (http://www.ejel.org).

Aarhus, Denmark, August 9-10, 2010
www.sigcse.org/icer/2010

Computing education research is the study of how people come to understand computational processes and devices, and how to improve that understanding. As computation becomes ubiquitous in our world, understanding of computing in order to design, structure, maintain, and utilize these technologies becomes increasingly important--both for the technology professional, but also for the technologically literate citizen. The study of how the understanding of computation develops, and how to improve that understanding, is critically important for the technology-dependent societies in which we live.

The International Computing Education Research (ICER) Workshop aims at gathering high-quality contributions to the computing education research discipline. Papers for the ICER workshop will be peer-reviewed and should, as appropriate, display:
 

    * A clear theoretical basis, drawing on existing literature in computing education or related disciplines.
    * A strong empirical basis, drawing on relevant research methods. Papers that re-interpret and explain others' empirical results are welcome.
    * An explication of the paper's impact on, and contribution to, existing knowledge about computing education.


Papers should be no more than eight pages long.  Papers should follow the ACM SIGCSE formatting guidelines. Templates for submissions can be found at the ACM SIG Proceedings website. LaTeX users should use option #2 (tighter alternate style) when formatting their document.

Submission deadline: 	20 April 2010
Notification of acceptance: 	10 June 2010
Deadline for final version: 	24 June 2010

A Doctoral Consortium will be held the day prior to ICER 2010, on Sunday, August 8.

=========================================================================


Quick adoption of mashup and lightweight composition technologies is one of
the landmarks of contemporary World Wide Web evolution. The MEM 2010
workshop will adopt a multi-aspect perspective on these technologies to
enable a complex understanding of their adoption, research and business
challenges and prospects. Firstly, it will cover basic infrastructures and
standards enabling scalable, secure and flexible deployment and enactment
of mashup and lightweight composition technologies. Secondly, it will focus
on user interfaces and interaction paradigms that make different approaches
to user-driven content and functionalities composition available to
non-expert users and collaborating crowds. Thirdly, it will take a look
into remarkable cases of mashups that combine existing services and
information sources with intelligent information processing algorithms and
user collaboration to provide value-added services. Finally, the workshop
will cover topics related to business aspects of mashup and lightweight
composition technologies (enterprise mashups).

The major part of innovation related to mashups and lightweight composition
is now happening in open on-line Web sites intended for wide audience from
all over the world. However, these technologies have prospects of becoming
major evolution factor for contemporary enterprises by bridging the gap
between business and IT. Thus, the workshop will focus both on usage of
mashup solutions in open environments underlining the requirement for
flexibility, performance and privacy preservation, and in business
environments stressing the need for security and control measures to be
incorporated in mashup and composition solutions.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a platform for discussing research
topics underlying the concepts of lightweight composition, mashups, and
enterprise mashups. By bringing together representatives of academia and

**********************************************************************

Artificial  Intelligence and  Symbolic Computation  are two  views and
approaches for automating  problem solving, in particular mathematical
problem solving.  The two  approaches are based  on heuristics  and on
mathematical  algorithmics, respectively. Artificial  Intelligence can
be  applied to Symbolic  Computation and  Symbolic Computation  can be
applied  to Artificial  Intelligence. Hence,  a wealth  of challenges,
ideas, theoretical insights and  results, methods and algorithms arise
in  the  interaction  of  the  two fields  and  research  communities.
Advanced tools of software technology and system design are needed and
a broad spectrum  of applications is possible by  the combined problem

=====================================================

GOAL OF THE WORKSHOP:

Software reuse has been one of the most effective paradigms for building software systems and applications for decades. Recently, the rapid and fundamental advances in computing technologies have been driving the role and scope of software systems to new levels. A number of new types of software systems are emerging, among which service based systems, pervasive computing, cloud computing and Internet of Things are eminent examples. The advent of these emerging systems has raised the level of software reuse to services, large-scale components or agglomeration of components in more challenging context which is pervasive, service-oriented, embeded real-time, or in very large corporation scale. Systematic and large-scale reuse of reusable assets at multiple development levels is improving the efficiency of software development activities significantly in terms of cost and time.
 
However, previous research in software reuse mainly focused on the functional aspect of a system, tended to ignore or treat the quality aspects trivially, and did not address the new challenging features of the above emerging software systems. Modern computing models tend to be globally distributed, pervasive, and dynamically adaptive. These systems, such as SOA, pervasive computing and embedded systems, have imposed more rigorous quality requirements on software development technologies. It becomes a great challenge to meet the new requirements of emerging software systems and meanwhile enjoy the benefits of substantial software reuse.

Recently, the research community and industry have been aware of the above weakness and much work has been ongoing. In this workshop we wish to bring together researchers and practitioners to share research results, advances and practical experiences under the banner of ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂQuality Oriented Reuse of Software for Emerging Software SystemsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ. The workshop will act as a forum for active discussion, idea stimulation and communication.

FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

Workshop on Methods for the automatic acquisition of Language Resources and their evaluation methods

To be held in conjunction with the 7th International Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC 2010)
23 May 2010, Mediterranean Conference Center, Valletta, Malta

http://www.FlaReNet.eu/acquisition2010

Deadline for submission: 26 February 2010


While methods for the Automatic Production of Language Resources are being described in scientific papers, the proposed techniques and their results are somehow unrelated because the lack of a common forum where to share experiences and to compare results.

FlaReNet Working Group on ""Methods for the automatic construction and processing of Language Resources"" in cooperation with FP7 projects: ACCURAT (Analysis and Evaluation of Comparable Corpora for Under Resourced Areas of Machine Translation), PANACEA (Platform for Automatic, Normalized Annotation and Cost-Effective Acquisition of Language Resources for Human Language Technologies) and TTC (Terminology Extraction, Translation Tools and Comparable Corpora) organizes this LREC workshop whose aim is to be the beginning of a series of meetings that will be an enduring forum where researchers in the field can exchange information and compare results. 

The two main objectives of the workshop are:

* First, to start the compilation of information about current initiatives and available and proved applications for the automatic acquisition of Language Resources and, 
* Second, to start the creation of common materials for the evaluation and comparison of the results of these methods and techniques. 

This first workshop is organized in a series of presentation talks and an open poster session. For the open poster session, the organizers welcome contributions related to the techniques and applications of the automatic acquisition and production of language resources and their evaluation in one of the following areas:

* Automatic extraction and pre-processing of corpus
* Alignment techniques for parallel and comparable corpus
* Bilingual dictionaries extraction, including terminological resources
* Lexical Information Acquisition
* Tree-bank automatic building
* Grammar induction
* Automatic acquisition of multimodal resources
* Automatic acquisition of sign languages
Poster papers (in the LREC format available at the conference web page and that should not be longer than 6 pages , references included) may describe past evaluation exercises as well as work in progress.

Eleventh Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group  in Computational Morphology,  Phonology and Phonetics

     http://phonology.cogsci.udel.edu/sigmorphon2010/


The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested
in applying computational techniques to problems in morphology,
phonology, and phonetics.  Papers will be on substantial, original, and
unpublished research on these topics, potentially including strong work
in progress.  Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to) the
following as they relate to the areas of the workshop:

* Unsupervised, semi-supervised or machine learning of linguistic
   knowledge
* New formalisms, computational treatments, or probabilistic models
   of existing linguistic formalisms
* Models of psycholinguistic, experimental results
* Models of historical sound change
* Morpheme identification and word segmentation
* Finite-state methods
* Corpus linguistics
* Machine transliteration and back-transliteration
* Speech technologies relating to phonetics or phonology
* Speech science (both production and comprehension)
* Analysis or exploitation of multilingual, multi-dialectal, or
   diachronic data
* Integration of morphology, phonology, or phonetics with other NLP
   tasks
* Tools and resources

One of the missions of SIGMORPHON is to encourage interaction between
work in computational linguistics and work in theoretical phonetics,
phonology and morphology, and to ensure that each of these fields
profits from the interaction. Our recent meetings have been successful
in this regard, and we hope to see this continue in 2010.  Many
mainstream linguists studying phonetics, phonology and morphology are
employing computational tools and models that are of considerable
interest to computational linguists. Similarly, models and tools
developed by and for computational linguists may be of interest to
theoretical linguists working in these areas.  This workshop provides a
forum for these researchers to interact and become exposed to each
others' ideas and research.

We will hold a full-day workshop consisting of
approximately 12 half-hour presentations.

The workshop will be held on July 15, immediately after the ACL 2010
meetings at Uppsala University in Uppsala, Sweden.

The workshop website is: http://phonology.cogsci.udel.edu/sigmorphon2010/

Content: Papers should be original, topical, and clear. Completed work
is preferable to intended work, but in any event the paper should
clearly indicate the state of completion of the reported results.
Authors are encouraged to study the actual form used by reviewers
(http://phonology.cogsci.udel.edu/sigmorphon2010/review-form.html) to
assess papers.

Submission Format: The only accepted format for submitted papers is
Adobe PDF. Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL
proceedings, and should not exceed eight (8) pages. One additional page
is allowed for the References section.  Thus, your PDF file may be 9
pages. However, all material other than the bibliography must fall
within the first 8 pages!  We strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX
style files or Microsoft Word document template that are available on
the ACL conference web site (http://acl2010.org/authors.html).  We
reserve the right to reject submissions that do not conform to these
styles, including font size restrictions.

the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations.
Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g.,
""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."", must be avoided. Instead, use
citations such as ""Smith (1991) previously showed ..."". Papers that do
not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Conflicts of Interest: Authors should mark on the submission page any
program committee member with whom they have a conflict of interest,
such as a recent collaborator, a recent colleague at the same
institution, or a close personal friend.

Resources and Evaluation for Entity Resolution and Entity Management Workshop

        Workshop at LREC10
    Language Resources and Evaluation Conference
        Valletta, Malta  May 22, 2010


This workshop, open to all LREC participants, builds on the success of the workshop
held at LREC08 on Resources and Evaluation for Identity Matching, Entity
Resolution and Entity Management.  We hope to leverage results achieved since
that workshop and advance the state of the art.

There is currently great interest in the extraction and management of structured
information from unstructured text - a need that continues to grow with ever
increasing production of unstructured information.  Much of the information
extracted focuses on people, and this information must be managed - and searchable -
when stored in a structured repository.  This workshop will address the intersection of
the name/record matching, entity resolution, and entity management problems, with
a focus on evaluation methodologies suited to such systems and the language
resources necessary both to perform these tasks and to evaluate them.

Whereas entity extraction systems  are usually evaluated using MUC methodology,
for example, the case is less clear for these ""follow-on"" technologies.  Even a
seemingly simple task such as matching person names in a database context is
problematic, and although name or record matching systems can be evaluated using
IR evaluation methodologies (ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  la CLEF or TREC), there are still interesting
methodological issues to resolve before we can refer to a ""standard"" evaluation
methodology for name/record matching.  Moreover, it is much less clear how to
effectively evaluate identity matching, resolution, and management systems, or
even what it means to perform an effective identity match.

We solicit papers discussing state-of-the-art approaches to name and record
matching, identity resolution, and identity management, as well as novel proposals
for methodologies to evaluate these technologies.  Suggested topics include, but are
not limited to:

Position papers on the evaluation and integration of identity resolution technologies
will also be considered for acceptance.

Although we are distributing a call for papers and there will be papers accepted for
presentation at the workshop, this workshop will not be a ""mini-conference"".  Rather,
this workshop will be an interactive and dynamic event.  Presentations will serve to
introduce topics for discussion and to shape the day.  A significant portion of time
will be devoted to interactive exercises, brainstorming, and other ""work.""  The
workshop will be organized such that all attendees (including the organizers) leave the
workshop more informed-having made progress toward a contextualized and
principled evaluation of identity matching, resolution, and management systems-as
well as more connected, having begun interactive discussions that will continue after
the conference.

ICPR Workshop on Analysis and Evaluation of Large-Scale Multimedia Collections

Recent years have witnessed an explosive growth of multimedia content driven by the wide availability of massive storage devices, high-resolution video cameras and fast networks. Stimulated by recent progress in scalable machine learning, feature indexing and multi-modal analysis techniques, researchers are becoming increasingly interested in exploring challenges and new opportunities for developing much larger scale approaches for multimedia retrieval and mining. Many of these computationally-intensive ideas are now becoming practical because of the broader availability of high-speed clusters and the advent of cloud computing.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers and industrial practitioners interested in large-scale multimedia retrieval and mining. The workshop will provide a venue for the participants to explore a variety of aspects and applications on how advanced multimedia analysis techniques can be leveraged to address the challenges in large-scale data collections. Pivotal to many tasks is the availability of a sufficiently large dataset and its corresponding ground truth. Currently available datasets for multimedia research are either too small such as the Corel or Pascal datasets, too specific like the TRECVID dataset, or without ground truth, such as the several recent efforts by MIT and MSRA that gathered millions of web images for testing. While it is relatively easy to crawl and store a huge amount of data, the creation of ground-truth necessary to systematically train, test, evaluate and compare the performance of various algorithms and systems is a major problem. For this reason, more and more research groups are individually putting efforts into the creation of such corpus in order to carry out research on Web-scale dataset. The workshop will provide a forum to consolidate key factors related to research on very large scale multimedia dataset such as the construction of datasets, creation of ground truth, sharing and extension of such resources in terms of ground truth, features, algorithms and tools, etc.

All papers should address important issues in large-scale multimedia analysis, and demonstrate approaches that can scale to sufficiently large multimedia collections (e.g., hundreds of thousands of images, or hundreds of hours of video or audio content).
The list of possible topics includes:

* Indexing and retrieval for large multimedia collections (including images, video, audio and other multi-modal data)
* Large-scale copy detection and near-duplicate detection
* Video event and temporal analysis over large-scale multimedia sources
* Web-scale social-network and content-network analysis
* Machine tagging, semantic annotation, object recognition and ontology management on massive multimedia collections
* Collaborative image and video annotation for distributed users
* Interfaces for exploring, browsing and visualizing large multimedia collections
* Scalable and distributed machine learning and data mining methods for multimedia 
* Scalable and distributed systems for multimedia content analysis
* Construction and evaluation of large-scale multimedia collections

The 6th International workshop on  Wireless Network Measurements

                     May 31, 2010, Avignon, France
                     http://www.thlab.net/winmee10/

Scope
The rise in wireless technologies for both local and wide-area networking, 
such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, 3G and LTE, means that the Internet is
increasingly wireless. To better understand the nature of these changes, 
it is important to evaluate these technologies in real-world environments 
via empirical measurement. While analytical and simulation-based approaches 
are useful, they are often limited by the simplistic modeling of the 
wireless protocols and the varying and error-prone wireless channel. 
As a response to these limitations, the need for experimental wireless 
network measurements has gained wide recognition in the networking 
research community.

This workshop continues the successful WiNMee series, begun at WiOpt in 
2005, and is intended to bring together researchers in the field of
experimental wireless networking and serve as a forum for discussing 
advances and challenges in experimental wireless network measurements. 
We solicit 6-page papers that advance the understanding of wireless 
networks through testbed measurements or field experiments.  
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 

    - operational experience of the performance of wireless networks
    - challenges with wireless measurements
    - experimental (in) validation of simulation or mobility models 
      and assumptions in a wireless environment
    - metrics that would be required in a wireless network for 
      performance evaluation or wireless network troubleshooting
    - experience from building/designing wireless networks
    - descriptions of tools for building and/or managing wireless 
      testbeds (e.g. wireless link emulation)
    - large-scale or federated testbed measurements
    - techniques for improving the repeatability of tests, 
      simplifying experiment setup and reconfiguration
    - techniques for validating the results obtained in the wireless testbed
    - techniques for measuring heterogenous wireless networks
    - techniques for collecting, archiving, anonymising and sharing 
      wireless measurement data
    - new measurement hardware platforms, e.g., cognitive radio

======================================================================

The research fields of machine learning and data mining have received a great deal of attention in recent years and, beyond doubt, have established themselves as main cornerstones of intelligent systems design. Learning and extracting patterns from data is inseparably connected with various types of uncertainty, including randomness, vagueness, incompleteness, inconsistency and imprecision, which may concern both the input and output of a learning method as well as its internal representations of models or patterns. Probabiliy theory is an established methodology for handling uncertainty in a proper way, and is widely used in machine learning and data mining. Yet, it is becoming more and more apparent and accepted among researchers that probability does not capture all relevant forms of uncertainty equally well, and that other mathematical tools currently developed under the umbrella term ""soft computing"", notably fuzzy sets and related uncertainty formalisms, can complement classical probability in a reasonable way.

This special session, which is supported by the EUSFLAT working group on Learning and Data Mining and the IEEE CIS Task Force on Machine Learning, will focus on recent advances in the use of soft computing methods in machine learning and data mining. The organizers especially welcome contributions on the use of formal frameworks for reasoning under uncertainty such as, e.g., probabilistic and Bayesian methods, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, possibility theory, evidence theory, rough set theory, and information theory, to machine learning and data mining, including but not limited to data preprocessing, model induction (e.g., classification, regression), pattern mining and analysis (e.g., association rules, subgroup mining, clustering, novelty detection), formal concept analysis, handling of incomplete and heterogeneous data, analysis of non-stationary data and mining data streams, interactive and online data mining, mining at multiple levels of abstraction, incorporation of background knowledge, and visualization and presentation of data mining results.

                   In conjunction with HPDC 2010, June 22, Chicago, IL
                                 http://www.cct.lsu.edu/~kosar/didc10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Third International Workshop on Data Intensive Distributed Computing (DIDC'10) will be held in conjunction with the 19th International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC'10), in Chicago, Illinois.

The data needs of scientific as well as commercial applications from a diverse range of fields have been increasing exponentially over the recent years. This increase in the demand for large-scale data processing has necessitated collaboration and sharing of data collections among the world's leading education, research, and industrial institutions and use of distributed resources owned by collaborating parties. In a widely distributed environment, data is often not locally accessible and has thus to be remotely retrieved and stored. While traditional distributed systems work well for computation that requires limited data handling, they may fail in unexpected ways when the computation accesses, creates, and moves large amounts of data especially over wide-area networks. Further, data accessed and created is often poorly described, lacking both metadata and provenance. Scientists, researchers, and application developers are often forced to solve basic data-handling issues, such as physically locating data, how to access it, and/or how to move it to visualization and/or compute resources for further analysis.

This workshop will focus on the challenges imposed by data-intensive applications on distributed systems, and on the different state-of-the-art solutions proposed to overcome these challenges. It will bring together the collaborative and distributed computing community and the data management community in an effort to generate productive conversations on the planning, management, and scheduling of data handling tasks and data storage resources.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Data-intensive applications and their challenges
- Data Clouds, Data Grids, and Data Centers
- Data-aware toolkits and middleware
- Dynamic data-driven science
- Data-intensive scalable computing
- Data collection, provenance, and metadata
- Data placement, management, and scheduling techniques
- Network support for data-intensive computing
- Remote and distributed visualization of large scale data
- Data archives, digital libraries, and preservation
- Service oriented architectures for data-intensive computing
- Data virtualization, interoperability, and federation
- Data privacy and protection in a collaborative environment
- Peer-to-peer data movement and data streaming
- Future research challenges in data-intensive computing

Internet and traditional organizations continue to be faced with the challenge of making sense of the mountains of data that are everywhere, 
be it the blogs on the Web, transactions performed at Web-commerce sites, data generated by telecom switches, health care systems, 
bioinformatics and even in homeland security. In this new data-flooded world, the key question is: How do we analyze these enormous 
amounts of data in a timely and cost-effective manner? Clearly, the traditional model of building bigger machines and more storage does not 
apply here as the data is growing at a rate which is impossible to keep up with using scale-up methods. The promising solutions, such as those 
based on MapReduce, use racks of commodity servers with locally attached storage and are able to scale out quickly at low cost. In general, there 
is a need to assemble resources on demand ? the motivation for Cloud Computing. Broadly speaking, Cloud Computing represents the desire to migrate 
from the traditional server-centric computing architecture to a totally network-centric architecture where logical computing resources can be 
assembled flexibly, on demand. MapReduce is a software framework introduced by Google, in an attempt to bring the benefits of cloud computing to 
tackling the problems posed by massive datasets. While the early signs in terms of support from the developer community, academia and industry are 
quite encouraging, there are many open problems that still need to be addressed. Some of them are:

    * Is there a class of problems/workloads for which this distributed computing over commodity machines is the best solution?
    * How amenable are these algorithms to expression using MapReduce or other simple paradigms?
    * How do we define and use effective and practical metrics to compare the capability of different solutions being offered?
    * Do we need different solutions for different data types or algorithms? How do we build bridges between them?
    * Are there viable alternatives, such as Pregel or others for important sets of problems?
    * How do we integrate these new computing platforms with existing traditional data warehouse-based analytics systems?
    * Challenges in managing the massive datasets - Security, versioning, archiving?
    * Tackling the legal/moral challenges associated with mining those datasets?

We invite researchers working in any of the following areas to participate:

    * Data intensive applications of cloud computing
    * Algorithms for massive data analysis such as data mining, statistics, network, and predictive algorithms
    * Distributed data management, retrieval and mining
    * Novel architectures for cloud computing
    * Map-reduce and its generalizations
    * Large scale social media analysis
    * Privacy Preservation in Cloud
    * Parallel databases
    * Storage as a Service
    * Cloud resource management
    * Fault Tolerance Assessment and Management
    * Reliability of applications running over the cloud

International Workshop on Linking of User Profiles and Applications in the Social Semantic Web
Heraklion, Greece, EU


Nowadays, numerous Web applications rely on implicitly or explicitly collected data on their users and their behavior in order to provide adapted and personalized contents and services. As these applications become increasingly connected, a major challenge is to allow various applications to exchange, reuse, and integrate their data and user models, hence, to allow for user modeling and personalization across application boundaries. A great body of Semantic Web research on the use of well-defined standards, vocabularies, and ontologies is currently being adopted to provide extensibility, flexibility, interoperability, and reusability.

On the one hand, the ability of exchanging, reusing, and integrating the user models allows applications to enhance and broaden their user models with additional data. On the other hand, it helps users to get the content and services that suit their needs and situations and to syndicate these services in so-called mash-ups. This type of open-world user modeling poses several challenges to the Semantic Web community:

    * How can Semantic Web technology be employed to cope with semantic and syntactic heterogeneity in user modeling?
    * How can personalization and user modeling techniques be beneficial for Semantic Web systems?

This workshop aims to bring together academic and industrial researchers and practitioners in the fields of Semantic Web, user modeling, and personalization in order to discuss theoretical and practical knowledge, open research issues, applications, and experiences for common benefit. 

Topics

The workshop will tackle challenges posed by linking user data and applications, including, but not limited to, the following themes:

    * User modeling and personalization in the Semantic Web
    * Aggregation and integration of distributed user data/profiles
    * Linking data on the Social Web
    * Semantic Mashups linking applications
    * Techniques for connecting distributed user-generated data
    * Methods for exchanging user data
    * Intertwining social networking services
    * Studies assessing the use of external/public user data for personalization
    * Applications demonstrating intermixing of user profiles from different sources

This workshop aims to bring together academic and industrial researchers and practitioners in the fields of Semantic Web, user modeling, and personalization in order to discuss theoretical and practical knowledge, open research issues, applications, and experiences for common benefit.

30 Years of Nonmonotonic Logic Workshop

Lexington, KY, USA
October 22 (Friday) - October 25 (Monday), 2010.

http://sites.google.com/site/nonmonat30/

The publication of the seminal issue on Nonmonotonic Logics by the
Artificial Intelligence Journal in 1980 resulted in the new area of
research in Knowledge Representation. This development changed the
paradigm of logic originated in antiquity, created an important area of
mathematical logic, and resulted in exciting discoveries of logical
techniques creating new bridges between logic, knowledge representation
and computation. The research contributed to mathematical logic,
computer science and philosophy, and changed the perspective on
applications of logic.

This conference aims to sum up the experience of the first 30 years of
nonmonotonic logics and map paths into the future. It will interleave
longer invited talks covering all major research trends of the past 30
years with shorter technical presentations providing an account of the
current research. Invited presentations will be published in an edited
book by the College Publications (http://www.collegepublications.co.uk/). A
special issue of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR;
http://www.jair.org/) will provide a venue for technical presentations (a
detailed CFP for the special issue will be distributed at a later time; a
rigorous peer review process in-line with JAIR quality standards will be
followed).

* Aim and Scope

     With the recent technological advances in portability, mobility support, and wireless communications, wireless peer-to-peer networks (WP2PNs) such as mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are receiving tremendous attention due to their emerging applications ranging from civil to military and becoming a ubiquitous communication infrastructure. However, the design of WP2PNs is inherently complex and become challenge because of mobility, lack of coordination, unreliability, and resource constraints such as energy, bandwidth, computing power, etc. 

The purpose of this workshop is to provide researchers and professionals in academia and industry with a forum for presenting their progresses/contributions, discussing recent edge-cutting technologies and innovative applications, exchanging new research ideas, and thinking future research directions in WP2PNs. Please keep checking this workshop homepage for more information and updates.

The contest opens to talented students (Students Group) and industry practitioners (Professionals Group). The contest focuses on using the SOA methodologies, solution reference architectures, and tools to solve real world problems. We choose a different theme each year, while the real world application is chosen by the participants. In the past, business SOA and mash-ups were chosen as themes. The 2010 theme is ""Applications and Algorithms with Clouds"".

We invite participants to study algorithms and application solutions under cloud computing architecture. Some typical applications on clouds can be business intelligence and social networks. Typical algorithms suitable for clouds can be information retrieval and machine learning. Each team is required to submit a technical paper and build a demo system which should be accessible on line. The demo system can use commercial clouds, like Amazon Web services, or private clouds.

The finalists will be invited to ICWS 2010 in Miami, USA for on-site contest. The papers of the finalists will be published in the proceedings of the 2010 IEEE Congress on Services (SERVICES 2010) which is collected in IEEE Digital Library.

       CALL FOR PAPERS

             ACL 2010 Workshop on Domain Adaptation  
           for Natural Language Processing (DANLP 2010)
             http://sites.google.com/site/danlp2010/

               July 15, 2010, Uppsala, Sweden

====================================================================

Most modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are subject to
the well known problem of lack of portability to new domains/genres:
there is a substantial drop in their performance when tested on data
from a new domain, i.e., their test data is drawn from a related but
different distribution as their training data. This problem is
inherent in the assumption of independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) variables for machine learning systems, but has started to
get attention only in recent years. The need for domain adaptation
arises in almost all NLP tasks: part-of-speech tagging, semantic role
labeling, statistical parsing and statistical machine translation, to
name but a few.

Studies on supervised domain adaptation (where there are limited
amounts of annotated resources in the new domain) have shown that
baselines comprising of very simple models (e.g. models based only on
source-domain data, only target-domain data, or the union of the two)
achieve relatively high performance and are ""surprisingly difficult to
beat"" (Daume III, 2007). Thus, one conclusion from that line of work
is that as long as there is a reasonable (often even small) amount of
labeled target data, it is often more fruitful to just use that.

In contrast, semi-supervised adaptation (i.e., no annotated resources
in the new domain) is a much more realistic situation but is clearly
also considerably more difficult.  Current studies on semi-supervised
approaches show very mixed results. For example, Structural
Correspondence Learning (Blitzer et al., 2006) was applied
successfully to classification tasks, while only modest gains could be
obtained for structured output tasks like parsing. Many questions thus
remain open.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a meeting-point for research
that approaches the problem of adaptation from the varied perspectives
of machine-learning and a variety of NLP tasks such as parsing,
machine-translation, word sense disambiguation, etc.  We believe there
is much to gain by treating domain-adaptation as a general learning
strategy that utilizes prior knowledge of a specific or a general
domain in learning about a new domain; here the notion of a 'domain'
could be as varied as child language versus adult-language, or the
source-side re-ordering of words to target-side word-order in a
statistical machine translation system.

Sharing insights, methodologies and successes across tasks will thus
contribute towards a better understanding of this problem. For
instance, self-training the Charniak parser alone was not effective
for adaptation (it has been common wisdom that self-training is
generally not effective), but self-training with a reranker was
surprisingly highly effective (McClosky et al., 2006). Is this an
insight into adaptation that can be used elsewhere?  We believe that
the key to future success will be to exploit large collections of
unlabeled data in addition to labeled data. Not only because unlabeled
data is easier to obtain, but existing labeled resources are often not
even close to the envisioned target application domain. Directly
related is the question of how to measure closeness (or differences)
among domains.

===============
Workshop Topics
===============

We especially encourage submissions on semi-supervised approaches of
domain adaptation with a deep analysis of models, data and results,
although we do not exclude papers on supervised adaptation. In
particular, we welcome submissions that address any of the following
topics or other relevant issues:

* Algorithms for semi-supervised DA
* Active learning for DA
* Integration of expert/prior knowledge about new domains
* DA in specific applications (e.g., Parsing, MT, IE, QA, IR, WSD)
* Automatic domain identification and model adjustment
* Porting algorithms developed for one type of problem structure to another (e.g.
from binary classification to structured-prediction problems)
* Analysis and negative results: in-depth analysis of results, i.e. which model
parts/parameters are responsible for successful adaptation; what can we learn
from negative results (impact of negative experimental results on learning strategies/
parameters)
* A complementary perspective: (Better) generalization of ML models, i.e. to
make NLP models more broad-coverage and domain-independent, rather than
domain-specific
* Learning from multiple domains

following the Association for Computational Linguistics meeting


in Uppsala, Sweden





            http://cmcl.ling.cornell.edu








CALL FOR PAPERS








Workshop Description





This workshop provides a venue for work in computational psycholinguistics.


ACL Lifetime Achievement Award recipient Martin Kay described this topic as


""build[ing] models of language that reflect in some interesting way, on the ways


in which people use language."" The 2010 workshop follows in the tradition of


three previous meetings





     (1) the computational psycholinguistics meeting at CogSci in Berkeley in 1997


     (2) the thematic session on computational psycholinguistics at ACL in 1999


     (3) the Incremental Parsing workshop at ACL 2004





in inviting contributions that apply methods from computational linguistics


to problems in the cognitive modeling of any and all natural language abilities.








Scope and Topics





The workshop invites a broad spectrum of work in the cognitive science of


language, at all levels of analysis from sounds to discourse. Topics include,


but are not limited to





* incremental parsers for diverse grammar formalisms


* derivations of comprehension difficulty predictions, or generalization predictions in language learning


* stochastic models of factors encouraging one production or interpretation over its competitors


* models of semantic interpretation, including psychologically-realistic notions of word & phrase meaning








Submissions





This call  solicits 8-page, full papers reporting  original and unpublished


research    that   combines    cognitive    modeling   and    computational linguistics.


Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop


and will be published in  the workshop proceedings. They should emphasize


obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the


state  of  completion  of  the  reported  results.  A  paper accepted  for


presentation at the  workshop must not be presented or have been presented


at any other meeting with  publicly available proceedings.  If essentially identical


papers are  submitted to other conferences or  workshops as well, this fact


must be indicated at submission time.





To facilitate double-blind reviewing, submitted paper should not include


any identifying information about the authors.





Submissions must be formatted using ACL 2010 style files available at





            http://www.acl2010.org/authors.html





Contributions should be submitted in PDF via the submission site:





            https://www.softconf.com/acl2010/CogModCL





The submission deadline is 11:59PM Eastern Time on April 5th, 2010.








Pathway to Journal Publication





All   accepted   CMCL   papers   will   be  published   in   the   workshop proceedings as


is customary at ACL. However,  CMCL presenters whose work holds  broad interest for


the wider cognitive science  community  will  be  encouraged to  prepare extended versions


of their papers (16  pages in APA format). If approved by a  second  round of  reviewing,


these extended  papers  will  appear in  a forthcoming issue  of TopiCS, a Journal of


the Cognitive Science Society, entitled entitled _Models of Language Comprehension_.


These expanded papers will need to be substantially adapted to address


the broader TopiCS readership. The  Program Committee will be assisted by additional experts,


as needed, to apply this and other review criteria.








Student Paper Award





Submissions should be marked to indicate whether the first author is pre-doctoral or not.


Papers in this category are eligible for the CMCL Student Paper Award.


This $250 award is sponsored by the Cognitive Science Society.








Important Dates





Submission deadline: April 5, 2010


Notification of acceptance: May 6, 2010

AIMS AND GOALS OF THE WORKSHOP

In recent years real-time multimedia services have been contributing extensively to our life experience and are expected to be among the most important applications in the future Internet. The management of content distribution services is an important key to attract and keep customers, while increasing profits to content providers. At the same time the complexity and dynamics of content networks require special solutions in order to provide efficient delivery and deployment of real-time multimedia services. Further, emerging diverse and heterogeneous wired and wireless systems is a challenging research objective. The interoperability of applications, transport and network protocols, as well as, the demand for improved Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE), and seamless mobility control creates a challenging study field and also possibilities for research of novel communication protocols, architectures and methods towards Future Multimedia Networking Systems. Thus, one major challenge is the ever growing complexity of communication management and network maintenance. Solutions are required in which services, management and administration entities interact and behave autonomously, with the overall goal of creating content centric networks.

The objective of the Future Multimedia Networking - FMN 2010 workshop is to discuss state-of-the-art research and developing activities contributing to aspects of multimedia systems, content networking, and autonomous communication. We are inviting both theoretical and experimental papers as well as work-in-progress research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Content centric networks
- Autonomic content networks
- Audio-visual systems
- Novel protocols for multimedia services
- Grid networking for multimedia services
- Multimedia in personal, sensor and ad-hoc networks
- Multimedia in peer-to-peer networks and autonomic network infrastructures
- Multimedia in mobile and broadband wireless access networks
- Quality of service management in content centric networks
- Quality of experience management in content centric networks
- Seamless mobility of multimedia services in emerging content networks
- Multicast and broadcast multimedia service management
- Resource reservation for multimedia services
- Context-aware content distribution
- Energy-efficiency in content centric networks
- Multimedia Security

                URL: http://pergroup.realmv6.org

                Miami, FL, USA, December 6, 2010,

            held in conjunction with IEEE GLOBECOM 2010,

            and co-sponsored by IEEE HCCTC sub-committee,
            G-Lab, and The unbelievable Machine Company

Group communications have passed from research to deployment and back to a
research issue. Newly deployed services, in particular IPTV, P2P content
distribution, and collaborative applications, are stimulating current research
on multicast, broadcast, concast, and anycast. Emerging design issues for a
future multi-service Internet combined with the dynamic development of wireless
access techonologies challenge the community to rethink the position of group
communications along the stack.

The PerGroup workshop invites the community to share efforts in search of
seamless, pervasive group services, and to discuss directions on a
human-centric multi-service Inter-networking architecture. We welcome
contributions that design new solutions or analyze existing deployments, but
also those that present striking problem statements or early conceptual work.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

System Design & Methodology:
  - Architectures and protocols for fixed, wireless and ad hoc networks
  - Protocols and interfaces for intuitive group communications
  - Intra- and Inter-domain group communication
  - Native, overlay (including P2P) and hybrid multicast
  - Topology analysis & measuring, mining and modeling of 
  - media-rich social networks
  - Measurement, simulation and analytical studies as well as deployment
    experiences

Supporting Technologies:
  - Multipath routing / extension of emerging routing schemes
  - Cooperative relaying and network coding
  - Service placement and service location
  - Security and privacy issues for multicast, anycast, and broadcast
  - Real-time and QoS aspects

Applications:
  - Adaptive content distribution, e.g., video broadcasting
  - Application-layer traffic optimization and provider interaction
  - Multicast & anycast in a future multi-service Internet
  - New data distribution models to facilitate group communication
  - Frameworks for human centric based group communications

Good decision-making is dependent on comprehensive, accurate
knowledge.  But the information relevant to many important decisions
in areas such as business, government, medicine and scientific
research is massive, and growing at an accelerating pace.  Relevant
raw data is widely available on the web and other data sources, but
usually in order to be useful it must be gathered, extracted,
organized, and normalized into a knowledge base.

Hand-built knowledge bases such as Wikipedia have made us all better
decision-makers.  However more than human editing will be necessary to
create a wide variety of domain-specific, deeply comprehensive,
more highly structured knowledge bases.

A variety of automated methods have begun to reach levels of accuracy
and scalability that make them applicable to automatically
constructing useful knowledge bases from text and other sources.
These capabilities have been enabled by research in areas including
natural language processing, information extraction, information
integration, databases, search and machine learning.  There are
substantial scientific and engineering challenges in advancing and
integrating such relevant methodologies.

This workshop will gather researchers in a variety of fields that
contribute to the automated construction of knowledge bases.

There has recently been a tremendous amount of new work in this area,
some of it in traditionally disconnected communities.  In this
workshop the organizers aim to bring these communities together.


Topics of interest include:

* information extraction; open information extraction,
   named entity extraction; entity resolution, relation extraction.
* information integration; schema alignment; ontology alignment;
   ontology constrution.
* monolingual alignment, alignment between knowlege bases and text.
* joint inference between text interpretation and knowledge base
   pattern analysis, semantic analysis of natural language,
   reading the web, learning by reading.
* databases; distributed information systems; probabilistic
   databases.
* scalable computation; distributed computation.
* information retrieval; search on mixtures of structured and
   unstructured data; querying under uncertainty.
* machine learning; unsupervised, lightly-supervised and
   distantly-supervised learning; learning from naturally-available
   data.
* human-computer collaboration in knowledge base construction;
   automated population of wikis.
* dynamic data, online/on-the-fly adaptation of knowledge.
* inference; scalable approximate inference.
* languages, toolkits and systems for automated knowledge base
   construction.
* demonstrations of existing automatically-built knowledge bases.

-----------------------------------------------------------

CALL FOR PAPERS

The fourth annual North-Eastern Student Colloquium on Artificial Intelligence (NESCAI) will be hosted at University of Massachusetts Amherst (Amherst, MA) on April 16-18. Students are encouraged to submit papers describing new or previously submitted research and ideas in all areas of AI (see partial list below). The primary author on each submitted paper must be a student attending a school in the northeastern United States or eastern Canada. Due to generous sponsorship, a small $50 registration fee covers conference costs and two nights of accommodation. The conference website can be found at http://nescai.cs.umass.edu.

NESCAI is the premier student colloquium on AI, bringing together students from all areas of Artificial Intelligence research. The colloquium hosts students from the Northeastern U.S. and Eastern Canada and aims to foster an exchange of ideas, discussions and networking. NESCAI is sponsored by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Yahoo Inc.

Important Dates:

    * Paper Submission for Review: 1 March 2010
    * Reviewer Responses and Acceptance Decision: 22 March 2010
    * Final Revision of Accepted Papers: 5 April 2010 

Submission Details: We welcome both full and short papers. All accepted papers will be presented at a poster session and selected full papers will be accepted for talks.

FULL PAPERS (8 pages): Appendices may exceed the eight-page limit, but the reviewers are under no obligation to read any material beyond the page limit. Full papers may be:

    * Research papers presenting previously submitted or novel research in AI
    * Conceptual papers presenting and motivating new ideas and research directions in AI
    * Survey papers summarizing the state of the art in a particular sub-field of AI 

SHORT PAPERS (2 pages): Short papers may be:

    * Research abstracts
    * Progress reports on ongoing research 

All submissions will be peer-reviewed using a double-blind system by at least two graduate students in the respective areas. We encourage the resubmission of both previously and currently submitted papers, as long as this is indicated by the author. We will work with authors to ensure that copyrights held by other conferences will not be violated but we do not anticipate any problems, as there will be no formal publication of NESCAI proceedings.

All papers accepted by NESCAI (including those accepted as oral presentations) will also be presented as posters during one of the poster sessions. It is expected that all papers will be accepted for poster presentation, with only a select few being chosen for talks (based on peer reviews).

of two main parts: a peer-reviewed conference (20-21 September) on
experimental evaluation, which will innovate the CLEF tradition, and a
series of labs (22-23 September), which will continue the CLEF tradition of
community-based evaluation and discussion on evaluation issues.


Aim and Scope

The CLEF2010 conference aims at advancing the evaluation of complex
multimodal and multilingual information systems in order to support
individuals, organizations, and communities who design, develop, employ, and
improve such systems.

The growth of the Internet has been exponential with respect to the number
of users, media, and languages used regularly for global information
dissemination. Language and media barriers are no longer seen as inviolable
and they are constantly crossed and mixed to provide content that can be
accessed on a global scale within a multicultural and multilingual setting.

Users need to be able to co-operate and communicate across language and
media boundaries, going beyond separate search in diverse media/languages
and exploiting interactions between different languages and media.

Experimental evaluation - both laboratory and interactive - is a key to
fostering the development of multilingual and multimodal information systems
that address increasingly complex information needs.

The CLEF2010 labs will continue the CLEF tradition of community-based
benchmarking and will complement these with workshops on emerging issues in
evaluation methodology. Lab proposals were sollicited at an earlier stage
and and the 2010 lab program can be found at  http://www.clef2010.org/. 

At this time we invite submissions for presentation at the CLEF2010
conference. We welcome submissions on all aspects of multilingual and
multimodal information access evaluation. All submissions will be reviewed
on the basis of relevance, originality, importance, and clarity.

The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes
in Computer Science (LNCS) series.


Topics for Discussion

Relevant topics for CLEF 2010 include, but are not limited to:

- Novel methodologies for the design of evaluation tasks, especially
user-centric ones;
- Analysis of the impact of multilingual/multicultural/multimodal
differences in interface and search design;
- Assessing multilinguality and multimodality in relevant application
communities, e.g. digital libraries, intellectual property, medical, music,
video, and social media.
- Alternative methods for improving and automating ground-truth creation,
for example crowd-sourcing or clicklog-based;
- Prediction of success and satisfaction rates;
- Task-oriented metrics of success and failure;
- Evaluation of technology vs testing of scientific theories;

session-based evaluation;
- Simulation (of queries, sessions, users) and information retrieval;
- Infrastructures for bringing automation and collaboration in the
evaluation process;
- Component-based evaluation approaches;
- Evaluation and analysis using private or anonymized test data;

The Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Practical Issues in Building Sensor Network Applications
Calling for papers

Introduction:
Sensor nodes are tiny autonomous devices that combine sensing, computing and wireless communication capabilities. These nodes are deeply embedded into the physical surroundings, and gather and process information such as temperature, humidity, light characteristics, seismic activities or images and sound samples from the physical world. Networked systems of such sensors are expected to be used in a variety of applications including habitat monitoring, precision agriculture, disaster recovery operations, healthcare and supply chain management. Real world sensor network deployments and prototype implementations are still not commonplace. However, experiences gained in such deployments are crucial for the sensor network research community. These results will allow us to refine assumptions made when designing hardware, software, protocols and mechanisms for sensor networks.

SenseApp 2010, the Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Practical Issues in Building Sensor Network Applications, will be a one-day workshop, held in conjunction with the IEEE Conference on Local Comupter Networks (LCN 2010). The workshop aims at bringing together researchers from academia and industry to showcase their work and obtain feedback. We expect the workshop to act as a forum for the sensor network research community to discuss open issues, novel solutions and the future development of wireless sensor networks in general.

Scope:
Authors are invited to submit original unpublished work, not currently under review by another conference, workshop or journal. Full papers should be restricted to 8 camera-ready pages (in 10 pt font, double column, US letter size, 8.5 x 11 inches, IEEE format) including text, figures and references. Poster papers are an opportunity to present initial results and obtain feedback on on-going research. We also welcome submissions for demonstrations that showcase original research, practical implementations and realistic applications of wireless sensor networks. Poster/demo papers must be restricted to 2 camera-ready pages. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Experiences from real-world sensor network deployment and applications
Innovative sensor network applications
Middleware support for sensor networks

ABOUT THE WORKSHOP

LADIS 2010 will bring together researchers and practitioners in the
fields of distributed systems and middleware to discuss the
challenges of building massive distributed computing systems and
clouds. By posing research questions in the context of the largest
and most-demanding real-world systems, LADIS serves to catalyze
dialog between cloud computing engineers and scalable distributed
systems researchers, to open the veil of secrecy that has surrounded
many cloud computing architectures, and to increase the potential
impact of the best research underway in both the systems and theory
communities.

Due to the co-location with PODC, this year's LADIS will devote
special attention to promoting exchange of ideas between the theory
and systems communities on the topics related to design,
implementation, performance and underlying principles of large-scale
distributed systems and cloud computing.

This workshop invites work and promotes the exchange of ideas in the
following topics:

- Consistency, reliability and fault-tolerance models for cloud
  computing infrastructures and the technologies to support them
  (e.g. convergent consistency, transactions, state-machine
  replication).

- Novel storage organizations for large scale systems (e.g., no-SQL
  databases or key-value storage), snapshot and weak isolation
  models, scalable and elastic transaction approaches
  (e.g. mini-transactions), wide-area transactions.

- Large-scale infrastructure technologies (e.g. Chubby, Paxos,
  Zookeeper, group membership services, distributed registries).

- Support and programming models for scalable cloud-hosted
  applications and services (e.g. map-reduce, global file systems,
  pub-sub, multicast, group communication).

- Power and other resource management tools (e.g. virtualization and
  consolidation, resource allocation, load balancing, resource
  placement, routing, scheduling).

- Privacy tools and models (e.g. digital identity management,
  encrypting private data in the cloud, information flow in data
  centers).

Particular attention is given to challenges unique to the
large-scale distributed systems and cloud computing domains.

The workshop will last for a day and a half, which will include a
mix of presentation of accepted papers and as well as keynotes from
prominent industry speakers who have been there, made key decisions,
and can talk about the architectures of the world's most demanding
cloud platforms.

Previous LADIS keynote and invited speakers include Gennaro Cuomo
(CTO, IBM WebSphere), Jeff Dean (Google Fellow), James Hamilton
(technology guru for Microsoft's Cloud Computing initiative, now at
Amazon), David Nichols (Microsoft Windows Live), Raghu Ramakrishnan
(Yahoo! Fellow), Ben Reed (developer of Yahoo's Zookeeper), Marvin
Theimer (Principal Engineer at Amazon), Franco Travostino and Randy
Shoup (CTO and Chief Architect for eBay).

SUBMISSION AND LOGISTICS

To attend, you are invited to submit a position or short research
paper expressing new ideas, research directions, or relevant
opinions. Submissions consist of up to 5 pages using 11-point Times
Roman font, including title page with author names, and
bibliography. Submissions deviating from these guidelines will not
be reviewed. Submissions will be judged on originality, clarity,
relevance, and, above all, their likelihood of generating
discussion. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital
Library.

============================================================
Second INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP on 
Collaborative Agents -- REsearch and Development (CARE) 2010
31st August 2010, York University, Toronto, Canada

Abstract submission: April 14, 2010
Full paper submission: April 16, 2010

http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~xtg/CARE2010/
============================================================

The workshop is held in conjunction with the International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT).
http://www.yorku.ca/wiiat10/

Summary
=======

Collaboration is required when multiple agents achieve complex goals that are difficult or impossible to attain for an individual agent. This collaboration takes place under conditions of incomplete information, uncertainty, and bounded rationality, much of which has been previously studied in economics and artificial intelligence. However, many real world domains are characterised by even greater complexity, including the possibility of unreliable and non-complying collaborators, complex market and incentive frameworks, and complex transaction costs and organisational structures. This workshop's thematic focus is on collaborative and autonomous agents that plan, negotiate, coordinate, and act under this complexity.
 
This workshop aims to foster discussions on computational models of collaboration in distributed systems, addressing a range of theoretical and practical issues. We seek contributions of members in research and industry that use the agent paradigm to approach their problems.
 
Some issues of interest of this workshop are:
o How to enable agents to form and follow joint agreements and contracts in complex organisational and market driven domains.
o How to develop a comprehensive contractual formation/maintenance framework applicable to many application domains.
o How to build comprehensive customer lifecycle management systems for customers, including telecommunication consumers, students and patients.
o How to deploy lifecycle management systems in real world applications, such as healthcare, telecommunication, and smart campuses.
o How to design markets that are adequate for agents to act with incomplete and uncertain information of the behaviour of collaborating agents. 
o How to build MAS that work efficiently in partially regulated markets (where governance policy or partnership agreements govern part of the market).
o What are the implications of partial regulation on the management of contractual relationships and service delivery.
o How organisational structures influence the negotiation of agents and the distribution/execution of tasks.
o How to cope with collaborators that exhibit unreliable and non-conformant behaviour, eg where agreements are made but are not always conformed with.
o How can interventions and incentive structures assist in managing contractual relationships and service delivery.
o How to assign transaction costs to actions in planning, assignment, and execution in organisational structures. 
o How can transaction costs influence the social outcome of the system which is further influenced by the organisational context under which the collaboration takes place. 
o Can lessons learnt in game theoretic computation inform collaborative agent settings.
o What role does learning and adaptivity play in building organisational MAS.

The one day workshop will feature a mixture of invited talks, discussions and submitted contributions describing current work or work in progress in collaborative agent research and technology. The workshop environment fosters open discussions among all participants, particularly encouraging students to discuss their research topics and seek feedback from senior agent researchers.

Scope and Motivation

Networking technologies have experienced profound levels of advancement
over the last three decades. These evolutions have come about as a
result of relentless research and development efforts across all layers
of the network hierarchy. As these advances continue to transform our
everyday lives, many new challenges and opportunities are emerging in
the broader area of ""next-generation networking"". In particular, some of
the key focus areas include network heterogeneity, scalability,
virtualization, services and applications, security, manageability,
dependability, and performance predictability. Moreover, the
next-generation wireless networks are introducing even more niche

Fourth International Workshop on Trustworthy Ubiquitous Computing
 (TwUC 2010)

November 8-10, 2010, Paris, France

http://www.twuc.info
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fourth International Workshop on the vision of a trustworthy
ubiquitous computing will be held on November 8-10, 2010, in Paris,
France. The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 12th
international conference on Advances in Mobile Multimedia (iiWAS2010)
and the 8thInternational Conference on Advances in Mobile Computing &
Multimedia (MoMM2010). TwUC covers aspects of trust in ubiquitous
computing environments. The aspects of context, privacy, reliability,
usability and user experience related to ubiquitous computing
environments represent the main topics of the workshop.

Marc Weiser presented his vision of disappearing and ubiquitous
computing more than 15 years ago. The big picture of the computer
introduced into our environment was a big innovation and the starting
point for various areas of research. In order to totally adopt the idea
of ubiquitous computing several houses were build, equipped with
technology and used as laboratory in order to find and test appliances
that are useful and could be made available in our everyday life.
Within the last years industry picked up the idea of integrating
ubiquitous computing and already available products like remote
controls for your house were developed and brought to the marked.

In spite of many applications and projects in the area of ubiquitous
and pervasive computing the success is still far away. One of the main
reasons is the lack of acceptance of and confidence in this technology.
Although researchers and industry are working in all of these areas a
forum to elaborate security, reliability and privacy issues, that
resolve in trustworthy interfaces and computing environments for people
interacting within these ubiquitous environments is important. The user
experience factor of trust thus becomes a crucial issue for the success
of a UbiComp application.

The goal of the TwUC 2010 workshop is to provide an international forum
for scientists, engineers and industry to address recent research
results and to present and discuss their ideas, theories, technologies,
systems, tools, applications, work in progress and experiences on all
theoretical and practical issues.

Topics of Interest The conference program will include peer reviewed
full papers around but not limited to the following topics:

- Usability and HCI in Ubiquitous Computing Environments
	- Methods and concepts to enhance and ensure usability in 
	  UbiComp environments User experience in ubiquitous environ-
	  ments

Seventh International Conference on Data Integration in the Life Sciences
in Gothenburg, Sweden
August 25th - 27th 2010

The development and increasingly widespread deployment of high throughput experimental methods in the life sciences is giving rise to numerous large, complex and valuable data resources. This foundation of experimental data underpins the systematic study of organisms and diseases, which increasingly depend on the development of models of biological systems. The development of these models often requires integration of diverse experimental data resources; once constructed, the models themselves become data and present new integration challenges for tasks such as interpretation, validation and comparison.
Topics of Interest

DILS provides a forum for the discussion of emerging challenges for data integration in the life sciences, and the techniques that seek to address them. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

    * Architectures and data management techniques for the life sciences
    * Query processing and optimization for biological data
    * Biological Data sharing and update propagation
    * Query formulation assistance for scientists
    * Modeling of life sciences data
    * Biological Metadata management
    * Annotation in scientific data integration
    * Provenance modeling and management for the life sciences
    * Scientific Workflows and analysis pipelines
    * Laboratory information management systems in biology
    * Biological data quality and data cleaning
    * Life sciences ontologies
    * Semantic web for the life sciences
    * Mining integrated life sciences data
    * Text mining in the life science literature
    * Machine learning in data integration in the life sciences
    * Grid Computing and Grid technologies for the life sciences
    * System prototypes for biology
    * Commercial solutions in the life sciences
    * Integration challenges presented by new kinds of biological data
    * Scientific results arising from innovative data integration solutions

Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit original contributions of practical relevance and technical rigor, experience reports and demonstrations of relevance to data integration in the life sciences. DILS 2010 invites two types of papers:

   1. Research papers (up to 16 pages).
   2. System/Demonstration papers (up to 8 pages).

Papers describing commercial solutions are welcome as long as sufficient detail of the problem and its technical solution are provided.

Please find detailed instructions for preparing the camera-ready copy of your paper in Springer's LNCS Author and Volume Editor Instructions.

Description

Cloud computing is increasingly being used for what was known as ""on-demand"" and ""utility computing"". The services provided, the APIs and the applications that can be hosted by these Cloud providers have superseded the use of the grid, and are increasingly becoming popular with users. The Cloud is a paradigm shift, where details are abstracted from the users; they no longer need expert knowledge about using the various technologies and running their applications on service infrastructure. Cloud computing provides a consumption and delivery model for IT services based on Internet, and it typically involves the provision of dynamically scalable and virtualized services.

There services that are provided by various Cloud providers, which include commercial entities, such as Amazon and Google, as well as those that are open-source systems, such as provided by Open Cirrus and Eucalyptus.

In this workshop we will examine and explore the services, interfaces and types of applications that can be executed on Cloud systems. In addition, we are interested in the interfaces used to access the underlying services, the processes of using virtualization, the range and scope of applications that can be executed, the security used by these services, and aspects such a service level agreements and quality of service provided. In addition, we are keen to know about the services that are used, and whether these are appropriate for various types of applications, such as sophisticated workflows and HPC.

1. Workshop Description
         
This workshop aims at examining the relationship between linguistics and
NLP and studying
(1) the new methods in incorporating linguistic knowledge into statistical
    systems to advance the state of the art of NLP, and
(2) the feasibility of using NLP techniques to acquire linguistic knowledge
    for a large number of languages and to assist linguistic studies.

 Since early 1990s, with the advancement of machine learning methods and the
availability of data resources such as treebanks and parallel corpora,
data-driven approaches to NLP have made  significant progress. The success
of such data-driven approaches has cast doubt on the relevance of
linguistics to NLP.  Conversely, NLP techniques are rarely used to help
linguistics studies. We believe that there is room to expand the
involvement of linguistics in NLP, and likewise, NLP in linguistics, and
believe that the cross-pollination of ideas between the disciplines can
greatly benefit both fields.

 One common approach to take advantage of linguistic knowledge is to train
a statistical system on linguistically annotated data such as treebanks.
Another approach is to represent linguistic knowledge as rules in a
rule-based approach. This workshop is interested in research that goes
BEYOND these common approaches and explores new methods in incorporating
linguistic knowledge into statistical systems or using statistical systems
for linguistic knowledge discovery.

 The workshop will consist of one invited talk, 2-3 panels, group discussion,
and paper/poster sessions.


2. Topics of Interest
 
 The workshop is interested in research that explores new methods in
incorporating linguistic knowledge into statistical systems or using
statistical systems for linguistic knowledge discovery.
These include, but are not limited to, the following themes:

  [T1] Research that shows awareness of particular linguistic phenomena
       and its effects on statistical systems.

       For instance, being aware of syntactic phenomena such as scrambling,
       cross-serial dependencies and long-distance movement is very relevant
       to parsing (e.g., earlier work on using different grammar formalisms
       such as LTAG/CCG/HPSG/LFG to handle these phenomena or more recent
       work on non-projective dependency parsing).

       Similarly, being aware of word formation patterns (e.g., reduplication
       in Chinese) or allomorphic variation patterns (e.g., vowel harmony in
       Turkish) could help word segmentation and morphological analysis.
    

  [T2] New methods in incorporating linguistic knowledge into
       statistical systems to improve the start of the art.
      (e.g., as rules in a preprocessing step, as linguistic features in
       a statistical system, as filters for pruning a search space, as priors
       in an objective function).


  [T3] Research that demonstrates the feasibility of creating NLP systems to
       automatically acquire linguistic knowledge for a large number of
       languages.

       In order to make generalizations about language universals, linguists
        need to gather information about as many individual languages as
        possible.  However, knowledge about most languages is not complete.
        Can we use NLP techniques to acquire knowledge (e.g., basic word
        order, case marking, tense, aspect, word formation rules, etc.) for
        hundreds of languages, which could help in the construction of
        resources such as WALS (http://wals.info) (Haspelmath et al., 2005)?


  [T4] Research that demonstrates the benefits of using NLP techniques to
       help particular linguistic studies. For instance, given some language
       data, can the categorization of languages into families be automated?
       Can historical interactions between languages be identified
       automatically (e.g., areal effects and borrowings, but beyond just
       lexical borrowings)?  Can NLP tools run over corpora
       of different dialects of the same language systematically identify
       differences in the two dialects (e.g., not just word choice
       differences, but also choice and frequency of particular
       constructions)?
      

  The systems described in the paper should be properly evaluated and
   compared with the start of the art.

  On the submission form, please specify the theme that your paper falls into.

Workshop at ACL 2010

http://www.textgraphs.org/ws10/

Deadline for paper submission: Monday, April 5th, 2010

TextGraphs is at its fifth edition! This shows that two seemingly distinct
disciplines,
graph theoretic models to computational linguistics, are in fact intimately
connected,
with a large variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications
adopting efficient
and elegant solutions from graph-theoretical framework.

The TextGraphs workshop series addresses a broad spectrum of research areas
and
brings together specialists working on graph-based models and algorithms for
natural
language processing and computational linguistics, as well as on the
theoretical
foundations of related graph-based methods. This workshop series is aimed at
fostering an exchange of ideas by facilitating a discussion about both the
techniques
and the theoretical justification of the empirical results among the NLP
community
members. Spawning a deeper understanding of the basic theoretical principles
involved,
such interaction is vital to the further progress of graph-based NLP
applications.


Special Theme: Graph Methods for Opinion Analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------

For the fifth edition of TextGraphs, we propose the special theme: ""Graph
Methods for
Opinion Analysis"". This choice is motivated by two important factors: (1)
advanced
opinion analysis that aims to go beyond polarity recognition necessitates
the integration
of syntactic, semantic and logic structures and (2) previous work in NLP has
shown that
graph methods are very well suited to represent and exploit such structures
in learning
systems.

The aim is to bring together researchers from graph theory and opinion
analysis in
order to enable cross-fertilization of ideas. The proposed theme will
encourage
publication of early results and initiate discussions of issues in this
area. We hope that
this will help to shape future directions for ambitious opinion analysis
research and
provide a new, challenging problem motivation for research in graph
algorithms.

Finally, as the field of opinion mining advances towards deeper analysis and
more
complex systems, graphical approaches may become even more pertinent. For
instance,
graphs may be employed to capture opinion dynamics over time, or to model
interactions between opinion expressions across multiple modalities and, to
realize this,
new graph-based algorithms and inference methods may need to be developed.


Suggested topics
---------------------

We invite submissions on the following (but not limited to) general topics
(including those
from the special theme):
* Graph methods for sentiment lexicon induction
* Analysis of blog and web linking structures
* Graph methods for sentiment/opinion propagation
* Graph representation of data for opinion analysis
* Synonym/antonym graphs and their usage to extrapolate semantic orientation
* Social graphs and opinion analysis
* Graph-based representations, acquisition and evaluation of lexicon and
ontology
* Dynamic graph representations for NLP
* Properties of lexical, semantic, syntactic and phonological graphs
* Clustering-based algorithms
* Application of spectral graph theory in NLP
* Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning models based-on graphs
* Dynamic graph representations for NLP
* Comparative analysis of graph-based methods and traditional machine
learning
Techniques for NLP applications
* Kernel Methods for Graphs, e.g. random walk, tree and sequence kernels
* Graph methods for NLP tasks, e.g. morpho-syntactic annotation, word sense
disambiguation, syntactic/semantic parsing
* Graph methods for NLP applications, e.g. retrieval, extraction and
summarization of
information
* Semantic inference using graphs, e.g. question answering and text
entailment
recognition

Looking for paper submissions.

Motivated by the skyrocketing demand for radio spectrum, facilitated by regulatory policy movements, and enabled by advances in RF technologies, there has been significant research towards developing networking technologies for white spaces -- the allocated but unutilized and under-utilized radio spectrum. One noticeable example is the recent prototype development and FCC historical rulings on white spaces in the TV bands. This workshop aims at providing a timely venue for discussing the current activities and findings in the field of cognitive radio networks, dynamic spectrum access, interference prevention, coexistence, and regulatory issues. This workshop will focus on recent advances as well as challenging papers. Areas of interest include but are not limited to:

    * Spectrum Sensing and Spectrum Management
    * Cognitive Radio Test-Beds and Hardware Prototypes
    * DSA/Cognitive Radio Standardization Activities (e.g. IEEE P1900, IEEE 802.22)
    * Accreditation, Trust, & Security Mechanisms for DSA Networks
    * Cross-Layer Protocol Design
    * Cooperation and Game-Theoretical Protocols for Cognitive Radios
    * Practical Experience and System Implementation

Poster/Demo Submission Instructions:
Submission of a demo or a poster requires a written 3-page summary describing the demo or the research results that are to be presented. Submission should go through EDAS. The authors of the accepted posters/demos will have the option of whether to include a 3-page summary in the workshop proceeding, which will be archived by IEEE Xplore.

The workshop aims to serve as a discussion platform for leading researchers to address the key technical challenges in the design and implementation of dynamic spectrum access technologies. Therefore, the presentations are by invitation-only. However, we might accept a few poster/demo submissions in the presentation session as well.

The UT-Austin French and Italian Graduate Student Association proudly announces the Seventh Annual Graduate Student Conference at the Department of French and Italian, University of Texas at Austin on April 9-10, 2010. 

 This conference aims to evaluate conceptions of community in Italy, France, the Francophone world and the Italian Diaspora from an interdisciplinary perspective. We welcome papers encompassing either linguistics, literature, or both. Participants are asked to address communities, keeping in mind Benedict Anderson's theory of the ""imagined community"" or Edward Said's ""imagined geographies"". That is to say that participants should consider the idea that the community is an imagined space or population to which the individual belongs through their perception as part of the group. We aim to develop concepts of the community that encompass textual, visual, and/or aural media. We also wish to consider the development of language as a function of community identity.  

The literature keynote speaker will be Dr. Alec Hargreaves, Director of the Winthrop-King Institute for Contemporary French and Francophone Studies and Ada Belle Winthrop-King Professor of French at Florida State University. Dr. Hargreaves is the author, translator, and editor of several books and articles, including Multi-ethnic France: Immigration, Politics, Culture, and Society (2007), Memory, Empire, and Postcolonialism: Legacies of French Colonialism (2005), Post-colonial Cultures in France (1997).

===============================================================================

BACKGROUND

The advent of multicore and manycore systems requires that programmers
understand how to design, write and debug parallel programs effectively.
The increased complexity of multi-threaded parallel programming on
multicore platforms requires more insight into program behavior, and
necessitates the use of tools that can support programmers in migrating
existing software to multicore platforms, and in writing new multi-threaded
parallel software. Programmers need increasingly sophisticated methods
for instrumentation, measurement, analysis and modeling of applications.
To help software developers embrace the multicore revolution, we need
both sophisticated tools to support parallel software development, and an
extensible tool infrastructure that promotes integration of existing and new
tools, and simplifies information exchange and access.


TOPICS

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to

 * Static and dynamic analysis tools
 * Instrumentation, measurement, analysis, and modeling of applications
 * Analysis and visualization tools for assisting programmers with parallel
   software design
 * Active testing tools
 * Applications profiling and performance analysis
 * Data visualization and analysis infrastructures for interaction of tools


PAPER SUBMISSION

Submissions should be formatted according to the IEEE standard

Workshop on Multilinguality in Information Access Evaluation: Bringing Content, Users, Languages and Tasks into the Loop
Milton Keynes, England


Services and users of multilingual IR systems continue to evolve, with many new factors and trends influencing the field. E.g., we are moving to a situation in which there is no longer a single dominant language in which most online information is captured and, with the advance of broadband access and the evolution of both wired and wireless connectivity, users are not just information consumers, but also producers. Text now comes in many shapes: user generated, with low publishing threshold, heavily contextualised, often code switching and multi-lingual, and under little or no editorial control, changes the scene for much of the processing frameworks we previously have been able to assume: blogs, discussion forums, comments left behind on news sites, IM, SMS, Twitter: many new formats for textual interaction carry valuable and timely information, which needs specific tools for processing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

MOTIVATION

Logistics is concerned with the organization and control of processes in
space and time in order to transport or manufacture goods and the
coordination of the resulting flows of material and information, as well as
monetary flows. Complexity and dynamics of logistic networks have reached a
level that more and more prevents the processes from being entirely
observable and fully controllable, caused by, e.g., a globalized economy, a
shift from buyer's to seller's markets, and shorter product life cycles.
Thus, recent trends in logistics point towards solutions with distributed
and self-organizing processes.

Such logistic networks are characterized by a wide variety of heterogeneous
properties, constraints, and requirements: temporal (very quickly, just in
time), economic (low cost, given budget), physical (smooth, secure travel),
informational (public, secure data), environmental (low energy,
ecology-preserving). Different qualities or modalities need different
representations; transitions between different subsystems require interfaces
between different representations, transformations of processes, and methods
for their selection; knowledge about situations and goals is crucial for the
selection of the most suitable strategy; etc. This manifold set of demands
and the emerging uncertainty requires the inclusion of methods from
artificial intelligence and cognitive science. AIL-2010 addresses the use of
these AI methods in modern logistics.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOPICS OF INTEREST

This workshop addresses researchers from logistics that utilize and develop
AI approaches as well as researchers from AI that apply their work in
logistics or see possibilities to connect to logistic problems or methods.

We encourage contributions from the following research and application
areas:

Possible Research Areas:	

Coordination in Space and Time
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
Multi Modal Interaction
Cognitive Robotics
Cognitive Modeling
Spatial and Temporal Reasoning
Ontologies
Logic and Constraint Programming
Ambient Intelligence
Planning and Scheduling
Multi Agent Systems
Data Mining
Case-Based Reasoning
Machine Learning
Human-machine Interfaces
...

Possible Application Areas:

Transport logistics
Production planning and control
Assembly and disassembly
Process modeling and monitoring
Process planning
Intelligent manufacturing systems
Production Scheduling
Inventory organization and optimization
Automated inspection and quality control
Supply chain management
Traffic management
...

A special focus will be given to applying AI techniques in order to
integrate and interact with humans within the logistic process, may they be 
users, system designers, analysts, or other stakeholders. Intelligent
logistic systems will instruct users; they communicate and explain their
situation and reasoning upon demand; they notify managers about anomalies or 
in case of an emergency; they engage in clarification dialogs upon
misunderstandings. The better the human interface becomes, the more we
expect logistic scenarios to become re-populated by users such that shared  
human-machine scenarios may benefit from human expertise and intelligence   
while operators are relieved from tedious automated routine. This way we
move from a de-centralized view of cooperating autonomous units to an
""emancipated"" society of logistic units interacting among themselves and
with human agents. We explicitly encourage submissions that tackle this
challenge.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Submitted papers must be in PDF format and follow the ECAI style guidelines.
Technical papers must not exceed a length of 6 pages.

We also welcome the submission of position papers or papers describing work
in progress as short papers. Short papers must not exceed a length of 3

Distributed systems research covers a wide spectrum of applications ranging across embedded real/time systems, commercial transaction systems, transportation systems, and military/space systems.  Such systems are subject to some paradigms including coordination due to the absence of centralization, and too much uncertainly result of hardware of software behaviors, heterogeneity and son forth. Indeed, such systems raise several issues not found in single processor systems. The main difficulty arises when considering dependability, security, adaptability and resources constrained computing. This area requires computing systems to run software in an efficient and trustworthy way. That is, in order to be able to design complex architectures in reasonable time, novel and effective design methodologies are needed to automatically build applications from high-level descriptions to take into account what needs to be deployed on hardware. To remedy this weakness, combining both model and component seems to be a very promising cocktail for building solutions to this problem.

The introduction of the component approach in the development of embedded systems allows facilitating their design by building through an assembly of existing components. Indeed, this approach provides a clear separation between the specification and implementation of components. Note however that in the context of component software, distributed architecture is significantly more demanding than that of traditional monolithic integrated solution. Model-driven engineering provides a very useful contribution for the design of distributed systems since it bridges the gap between design issues and implementation concerns. It helps the designer to concentrate on application structure and required behavior and it permits us to specify in a separate way non-functional requirements such as underlying execution infrastructure/middleware, dependability and security issues that are very important to guide the implementation process.

The supporting research in the distributed systems area includes system architecture, design techniques, testing, validation, proof of correctness, modeling, software reliability, operating systems, parallel processing and real/time processing. The goal of this workshop is to present significant works dealing with the design of distributed architecture and applications for embedded systems using both model-driven approach and component-based development. Architecture design involves defining how the architecture is specified.  Here, we focus on design tools with some view of the possible implementations frameworks providing run-time support to take full benefits of existing infrastructure to build flexible efficient distributed systems.

========================================

Workshop for Negation and Speculation in Natural Language Processing

Organised by the University of Antwerp and Saarland University

July 10, 2010, Uppsala, Sweden

http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/NeSpNLP2010

========================================

Papers are invited for the one-day workshop to be held in Uppsala on the 10th of July, 2010.

In recent years, research has yielded substantial progress in NLP tasks like NE recognition, WSD, parsing, semantic role labeling, and anaphora resolution among others. This has been in part supported by the organisation of  shared tasks, which provide annotated data, a definition of the task and an evaluation framework, motivating researchers to develop new techniques to tackle these tasks. Other tasks like paraphrasing, summarization or textual entailment have also progressed, but results are still relatively low because deep understanding of language - mapping meaning to meaning - is necessary. This raises methodological questions. Furthermore, large scale linguistic resources are still lacking.

Negation and speculation are two phenomena involved in deep understanding of text. Both are related to expressing the factuality of statements, that is, expressing to which extent a statement is or is not a fact or a speculation. Negation turns an affirmative statement into negative (it rains/it does not rain). Speculation is used to express to which extent a statement is certain or speculated (it might rain/apparently, it will rain/ it is likely to rain/it is not clear whether it will rain/we suspect that it will rain).

SCOPE AND TOPICS

In this workshop we aim at bringing together researchers working on negation and speculation from any area related to computational language learning and processing. The general goal of the workshop is to stimulate research about these topics. Specific goals are to describe the lexical aspects of negation and speculation, to define how the semantics of these phenomena can be modelled for computational purposes, to explore techniques aimed at learning the factuality of an statement, and to  analyse how the treatment of these phenomena affects the efficiency of NLP applications. Finally, the workshop aims at encouraging discussion about the need of deep linguistic processing as a way to take computational linguistics a step further.

The wokshop will address the following aspects of negation and speculation, although it will be open to other related topics:

- Lexical  aspects of negation and speculation
- Linguistic resources with information about negation and speculation: corpora, dictionaries, lexical databases 
- Descriptive analysis of negation and speculation cues
- Negation and speculation across domains and genres
- Negation and speculation in biomedical texts and biomedical text mining 
- Handling negation and speculation in NLP: dialogue systems, sentiment analysis, text mining, textual entailment, information extraction, machine translation, paraphrasing
- Learning the scope of negation and speculation cues
- Interaction of negation and speculation for evaluating the factuality of an statement
- Corpora annotation: guidelines, bootstrapping techniques, quality assessment
- Modelling factuality for computational purposes
- Algorithms to learn negation and speculation
- Structured prediction of negation and speculation 
- Joint learning of negation and speculation
- Inference of factual knowledge

MOTIVATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the past decades, we have seen a revolution in the way science and engineering has been conducted. Specially, computation became an established third brand of science alongside theory and experiment. Scientists now need to access and exploit computational resources and databases that are geographically distributed through the use of high speed networks. Those resources must be modeled and managed in a similar way we model software development and data through software engineering processes and database techniques. In order to attack the next generation of scientific problems, multidisciplinary and distributed teams of scientists need to collaborate to make progress on these new challenges.

Current advances in Software Engineering and Database research, including ontologies, scientific process/workflow modeling, semantic web services, software component management, grid computing, resource modeling, process and data provenance, data curation, among others can help to address these challenges. Several national and international projects around the world have been initiated to carry out research and innovation activities that will transform the goal of e-Science and Grid computing into a reality.

The IV e-Science workshop aims at bringing together recent developments in databases and software engineering towards a computerized infrastructure to accomplish science in the large, supporting the next generation of scientific research and experiments. The definition, execution and management of scientific experiments can no longer be developed in an ad-hoc manner.

This workshop serves as a forum to present, discuss and establish new partnership among scientists that participate in research and product/tool developments, and highlights related activities from the Brazilian and international community. The first three versions of the event were co-located with SBBD/SBES, and showed that there is an interesting audience on the theme. New projects are taking place, based on partnerships on the database and software engineering area. In this forth edition, we would like to extend the possible fields of collaborations to other areas of Computer Science that have much to contribute to e-Science.

In Conjunction with BPM 2010 (The 8th International Conference on Business Process Management)


=== Aims and Scope ===

The current complexity inherent in the corporative world demands a great dynamism from the IT infrastructure in order to provide technical solutions for conducting business. Business Process Management (BPM), including its service-oriented foundation, has been providing important technological support to improve organization competitiveness. In order to increase dynamism and competitiveness, BPM can benefit from reuse approaches and techniques at several stages of business process life cycle.

The 1st International Workshop on Reuse in Business Process Management will be dedicated to explore any type of reuse in the Business Process Management domain. Therefore, it will be a forum to discuss systematic reuse applied to BPM at its various levels:

   1. the basic service-oriented foundation level ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ including issues such as service development, description, publication, discovery and selection;
   2. the service composition level ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ encompassing service negotiation and service aggregation;
   3. the management and monitoring upper level ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ including business process modeling, execution, monitoring, and contract establishment and enactment;
   4. the Quality of Service and Semantics orthogonal level.

Moreover, the impact of reuse on business- and service-oriented engineering as well as how it can help in the design of more high-quality process models are very important topics to be discussed in this workshop.

Different existing reuse approaches and techniques can be extended to be applied to this fairly new domain, including: software product line or software product families; variability descriptors; design patterns such as feature modeling; aspect-orientation; and component-based development. In addition, completely new approaches and techniques can be proposed. Their use must also be discussed, preferably under experimentation as well as results analysis.

1. Conference Description

The Eleventh Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI-10) will provide an international forum for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences which concentrate on AI technologies and their applications in areas of social and economic importance for countries in the Pacific Rim.

PRICAI2010 will be held at the Novetel Hotel in Daegu, Daegu is the fourth largest city in South Korea and has been the center of history, administration, education, and culture. The city has many cultural heritages and tourist attractions to well display Korean culture as well as complexes, department stores and large shopping malls.


2. Special session on (Semi-)automatic Creation of Language
     Resources for Asian Languages

 As part of the conference, we are organizing a special session on
  (Semi-)automatic Creation of Language Resources for Asian Languages.
  Language resources (e.g., parallel/comparable corpora,
  treebanks/Propbank/discourse treebanks, WordNet, FrameNet,
  and dictionaries) are invaluable for natural language processing.
  In the past two decades, there have been much effort in creating
  such resources; however, many of the studies rely on manual annotation,
  which is labor extensive and expensive.

 This special session aims to provide an opportunity for researchers
  to share their ideas and efforts in automating the process of creating
  language resources for Asian languages. Topics of interest include but
  are not limited to:
    * Automatic extraction of bilingual/comparable corpora from the Web
    * Automatic compilation of bilingual/multi-lingual dictionaries
    * (Semi-)automatic annotation of treebanks
    * (Semi-)automatic creation of WordNet and FrameNet for a new language
    * Automatic merging of language resources with different annotation
        schemes and/or from different sources


3. Important dates:
 * Submission deadline: March 31, 2010, 23:59 Pacific standard time (PST)
 * Notification: May 15, 2010
 * Camera-ready deadline: May 31, 2010
 * Conference date: Aug 30 - Sept 2, 2010


4. Submission information

 The papers should report original and unpublished research on topics of
interest for the special session. Accepted papers are expected to be presented
at the conference, and will be published in the conference proceedings. They
should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should
indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.

 Papers for special sessions should be prepared in accordance with the
PRICAI 2010 requirements (http://sc.snu.ac.kr/PRICAI10/PRICAI10Prep.html),
and submitted through the PRICAI 2010 submission website

75,Reliable and Autonomous Computational Science Conference,27/10/2010,27/10/2010,"Atlanta, GA, USA",31/05/2010,30/06/2010,31/08/2010,"A CALL FOR PAPERS
Reliable and Autonomous Computational Science Conference
In Atlanta, Georgia, USA, on the 28th October 2010

Theme & Goal
 Increasing size and complexity of software and hardware systems makes it harder to ensure their reliability. At the same time, the issues of autonomous computing become more critical as we more and more rely on software systems in our daily life. Such complexity is getting even more critical with the ubiquitous computing of embedded devices and other pervasive systems. These trends make it necessary to support software engineers with a set of techniques and tools for developing reliable and autonomous software. To cope with the growing complexity, RACS focuses on is a place for highly original ideas about reliable and autonomous software. The purpose of the RACS 2010 is to bring together researchers from diverse communities who are interested in building reliable and autonomous computing technologies more robust, and to discuss and exchange experimental or theoretical results, novel design, work-in-progress, experience, case study, and trend-setting ideas.


Papers
 Authors are invited to submit original papers in all areas of reliable software and autonomous computing. All papers will be fully refereed and undergo a blind review process by at least three referees. All accepted papers should be submitted in ACM 2-column camera-ready format for publication in the conference proceedings. The final version of the paper should not be more than 6 pages long; 4 extra pages will be allowed at additional cost. Selected papers will be recommended for publication in an International Journal as a special RACS 2010 section.


Wokshop Proposal
 In conjunction with the RACS 2010 conference, a number of workshops will be organized. Workshop proposals which should include ""Title of the workshop"", ""Short bio of organizers"", ""A tentative list of TPC"", and "" A tentative website address"" are to be sent to the workshop Chair(stjhang@suwon.ac.kr) by March 10, 2010.

77,Fourth Symposium on Semantic Mining in Biomedicine,25/10/2010,26/10/2010,"Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, UK",30/07/2010,30/08/2010,24/09/2010,"CALL FOR PAPERS
The Fourth Symposium on Semantic Mining in Biomedicine
will be held at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) in
Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, UK on October 25th and 26th, 2010.

SMBM 2010 aims to bring together researchers from text and data mining
in biomedicine, medical, bio- and chemoinformatics, and researchers
from biomedical ontology design and engineering. SMBM 2010 is the
follow-up event of SMBM 2005 (EBI, U.K.), SMBM 2006 (University of
Jena, Germany) and SMBM 2008 (University of Turku, Finland).

A parallel event (LBM: The International Symposium on Languages in
Biology and Medicine) has been held in 2005 (KAIST, Daejeon, South
Korea), 2007 (Matrix, Biopolis, Singapore) and 2009 (Jeju Island,
South Korea).

The biomedical research community eagerly awaits the full integration
of very large text collections, biological databases, ontologies and
terminological resources. However, many challenges have yet to be met
to achieve this ambitious goal. Significant advances have been made
and many working systems for tasks ranging from entity recognition and
simple relation extraction to structured event extraction have been
deployed. Where do we stand and how do we advance toward fully
integrated systems combining the different tools and data sources?

We are inviting papers from a full range of topics (see below),
emphasizing in particular work on methods deployed in a
production-like research environment, the integration of text with
domain resources such as micro-array data and ontological resources
such as GO, UMLS etc. We also welcome contributions from across the
biomedical domains, including genomics, translational medicine,
clinical practice, and public health.

For detailed up-to-date information, please consult the web site of the
conference: http://www.smbm.eu/

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

    * Text mining, information extraction, and information retrieval
    * Terminology and ontology development for biomedical information
      systems
    * Evaluation techniques and standards for text mining solutions
    * Integration of text and data mining in the biomedical domain
    * Annotation schemes for biomedical corpora
    * Text mining for resource building, e.g. ontologies, and resource
      enrichment, e.g., biomedical databases
    * Representation and discovery of biomedical domain knowledge
    * Privacy/trust, e.g in processing of patient records
    * Image/caption processing in relation to content extraction
    * domain-specific reasoning processes, e.g., to infer
      non-explicit information, validation (trust-worthiness,
      believability, safety) of extracted information
    * (Semantic) Web mining of biomedical information

All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings
that will be available online. We invite both full and short papers,
where full papers will be given an oral presentation and short papers
presented as posters. Selected papers will be invited to submit an
extended version for publication in the Journal of Biomedical
Semantics (JBMS).

Submissions should follow the instructions for JBMS authors, with a
limit of eight (8) pages for full papers and four (4) pages for short
papers (plus one optional page for references). Manuscripts will be
submitted electronically as PDF files. Reviewing will be double-blind,
and submissions should therefore NOT contain author names or other
obviously identifying information.

CALL FOR PAPERS

Evaluation of Information Filtering Systems in a Competitive Intelligence Framework Workshop
Workshop date: 22 May 2010
Held in conjunction with LREC 2010

Valetta, Malta

Aims

The constant growth of publicly available information has entailed a
consequently similar growth in the research areas devoted to the
automated organization of this information. In particular, Information
Filtering systems have been developed to tackle the issues of many
applications of business intelligence, from mail categorization to news
routing and technology watch. However, the theoretically challenging
models of these systems have seldom been evaluated in real usage
context. Indeed, standard evaluation benchmarks usually introduce
artefacts that simplify the task. For instance, in the context of
competitive intelligence, systems must filter documents without any
global information on a ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂcollectionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ but can use feedback from the user,
and must be efficient enough to deal with a real-time document stream.
Furthermore, with the increase of globalized access and availability of
the information, sources may be found in many languages, and the
multilinguality issue must also be considered. TREC Adaptive Filtering
Track and INFILE track at CLEF for multilingual information filtering
have tried to propose evaluation frameworks closer to the usage.

The goal of this workshop is to study different aspects of Information
Filtering Evaluation and to bring together researchers from the
community of Information Filtering to develop new evaluation frameworks
and confront current models with these new evaluation models.
Submissions are expected to propose new insights on evaluation
methodologies and resources for Information Filtering or to present
Information Filtering models that will meet the requirements of a real
usage evaluation (in particular, researchers that submit papers
presenting Information Filtering Models are encouraged to evaluate their
model using an existing benchmark such as the INFILE benchmark,
available at http://www.infile.org).

Topics

Both theoretical and practical research papers are welcome from both
research and industrial communities addressing the main workshop theme,
in any aspect including:
- Resources and methodologies for Evaluation of Information Filtering
Systems in real usage context
- New models for Information Filtering, that tackle one or several
issues of this kind of evaluation: efficiency, adaptability,
multilinguality, etc.
- Results of the Evaluation of Information Filtering Systems
- User studies of the use of Information Filtering Systems in
Competitive Intelligence

Submission information

Papers will be submitted to the workshop via the START LREC Conference
Manager, under https://www.softconf.com/lrec2010/InFile2010/
Authors should submit a PDF file of no more than 10 pages, following the
LREC conference formatting details. Papers will be reviewed by three
members of the Program Committee,
Accepted papers will be published in the workshop Proceedings.

92,35th International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science,23/08/2010,27/08/2010,"Brno, Czech Republic",15/04/2010,28/05/2010,14/06/2010,"35th International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science

MFCS Symposia

The series of MFCS symposia, organized in rotation by Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic since 1972, has a long and well-established tradition. The symposia encourage high-quality research in all branches of theoretical computer science. Their broad scope provides an opportunity to bring together researchers who do not usually meet at specialized conferences. Quality papers presenting original research on theoretical aspects of computer science are solicited.

The 35th International Symposiums on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (MFCS 2010) is organized in parallel with the 19th EACSL Annual Conferences on Computer Science Logic (CSL 2010) at the same place. There will be common plenary sessions and social events, but the technical program and the proceedings are prepared independently.

The federated MFCS & CSL 2010 conference is accompanied by several satellite workshops on more specialized topics.

WORKSHOP DATES: 23 August 2010 - 27 August 2010

Principal topics of interest

algorithmic game theory, algorithmic learning theory, algorithms and data structures (incl. sequential, parallel, distributed, approximation, graph, network, on-line, optimization), automata, grammars and formal languages, bioinformatics, complexity (structural and computational), computational geometry, computer-assisted reasoning, concurrency theory, cryptography and security, databases and knowledge-based systems, formal specifications and program development, foundations of computing, logic in computer science, mobile computing, models of computation, networks (incl. wireless, sensor, ad-hoc), parallel and distributed computing, quantum computing, semantics and verification of programs, theoretical issues in artificial intelligence.

SCOPE

The Internet has made it easier to perpetrate traditional crimes by providing criminals an alternate avenue for launching attacks with relative anonymity. The increased complexity of the communication and networking infrastructure is making investigation of the crimes difficult. Clues of illegal activities are often buried in large volumes of data that need to be sifted through in order to detect crimes and collect evidence. The field of digital forensics is becoming very important for law enforcement, network security, and information assurance. This is a multidisciplinary area that encompasses multiple fields, including: law, computer science, finance, networking, data mining, and criminal justice. The applications of this technology are far-reaching which include law enforcement, disaster recovery, accounting frauds, homeland security, and information warfare. This conference brings together practitioners and researchers from diverse fields providing opportunities for business and intellectual engagement among attendees. The conference is organized by the College of Information Technology at Zayed University with the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering (ICST).

TUTORIAL (tentative)

Advances in Digital Image Forensics
by Dr. Nasir Memon, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA

Given the ease by which digital images can be created, altered, and manipulated with no obvious traces, digital image forensics has emerged as a research field with important implications for ensuring digital image credibility. This tutorial will provide an overview of recent developments in the field, focusing on three problems. First, collecting image evidence and reconstructing them from fragments with or without missing pieces. This involves sophisticated file carving technology. Second, attributing the image to a source, be it a camera, a scanner, or a graphically generated picture. The process entails associating the image with a class of sources with common characteristics (device model) or matching the image to an individual source device, for example a specific camera. Third, attesting to the integrity of image data. This involves image forgery detection to determine whether an image has undergone modification or processing after being initially captured.

5th International Workshop on Distributed Cooperative Laboratories: Instrumenting the Grid

May 12-14, 2010
Poznan, Poland

A number of problems in science, industry and commerce, which require broad international cooperation, may be addressed by using sophisticated equipment and top-level expertise. Therefore, the development and dissemination of techniques and technologies that allow virtualized, remote and shared access to industrial or scientific instruments are essential for the progress of society. The possibility of using scientific or industrial equipment independently of their physical location helps towards equality of opportunity for and unification of communities, and subsequently provides new momentum for industry, science, and business.
The current edition of the Workshop goes beyond exploitation of remote instrumentation on the Grid. First of all, it focuses on new Remote Instrumentation (RI) aspects related to middleware architecture, high-speed networking, wireless Grid for acquisition devices and sensor networks, QoS provisioning for real-time control, measurement instrumentation and methodology. Additionally, it will provide knowledge about automation of mechanisms oriented to accompanying processes that are usually performed by a human. Another important point of this workshop is focusing on the future trends concerning RI systems development and actions related to standardization of remote instrumentation mechanisms.
The Workshop will be structured in technical sessions, some of which will be organized by leading researchers in the field, and will accommodate both invited and regular papers, selected on an open-call basis. INGRID 2010 allows also additional possibilities to be actively engaged in the conference program:
1) Special sessions - proposals for special sessions are welcome. Please provide the session description (1-1.5 page) including a draft session program. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the International Program Committee.
2) Extended abstracts - in alternative to full paper submission authors can provide an extended abstract (1-2 pages). The abstracts positively approved give a chance to make a presentation at the conference. A subsequent full paper will be reviewed independently, with a chance to add the paper to the post-workshop proceedings.

Modeling and Simulation (M&S) is increasingly becoming a central 
activity in the design of new systems and in the analysis of 
existing systems because it enables designers and researchers to 
investigate systems behavior through virtual representations. For 
this reason, M&S is gaining a primary role in many industrial and 
research fields, such as space, critical infrastructures, 
manufacturing, emergency management, biomedical systems and 
sustainable future. However, as the complexity of the 
investigated systems increases and the types of investigations 
widens, the cost of M&S activities increases because of the more 
complex models and of the communications among a wider number and 
variety of M&S stakeholders (e.g., sub-domain experts, simulator 
users, simulator engineers, and final system users). To address 
the increasing costs of M&S activities, collaborative 
technologies must be introduced to support these activities by 
fostering the sharing and reuse of models, by facilitating the 
communications among M&S stakeholders, and more generally by 
integrating processes, tools and platforms. 

Aside from seeking applications of collaborative technologies to 
M&S activities, the workshop seeks innovative contributions that 
deal with the application of M&S practices to the design of 
collaborative environments. These environments are continuously 
becoming more complex and therefore their design requires 
systematic approaches to meet the required quality of 
collaboration. This is important for two reasons: to reduce 
rework activities on the actual collaborative environment, and to 
maximize the productivity and the quality of the process the 
collaborative environment supports. M&S offers the methodologies 
and tools for such investigations and therefore it can be used to 
improve the quality of collaborative environments. 

A non-exhaustive list of hi-level topics includes: 

* collaborative environments for M&S 
* agent-based M&S 
* collaborative distributed simulation 
* net-centric M&S 
* web-based M&S 
* model sharing and reuse 
* model building and evaluation 
* modeling and simulation of business processes 
* modeling for collaboration 
* simulation-based performance evaluation of collaborative 
  networks 
* model-driven simulation engineering 
* domain specific languages for the simulation of collaborative 
  environments 
* domain specific languages for collaborative M&S 

To stimulate creativity, however, the workshop maintains a wider 
scope and invites interested researchers to present contributions 
that offer original perspectives on collaboration and M&S.

Knowledge Engineering in Global Software Development Workshop (KNOWING)


Knowledge engineering is an evolutionary process of engineering artefacts and using them to gain new understandings. These new understandings are then used to further engineer or modify artefacts and the process continues.
Knowledge engineering in global software development is being increasingly researched by the software and the knowledge management communities.
To implement a good knowledge management strategy in a global software engineering environment,organizations have to overcome issues which have been identified in many previous studies. These issues make global software distribution a difficult and complex task.
Hosting a workshop on this topic at the International Conference on Global Software Engineering will bring together researchers from both these communities in a forum where they can discuss and explore similarities between both communities' research.
Topics should have a global software development focus and include, but are not limited to:


*	knowledge management within software engineering from a business perspective 
*	collaboration and knowledge sharing 
*	knowledge discovery services and tools 
*	workflows and decision making including experiences with Wiki support 
*	methods and tools for managing knowledge 
*	architectural knowledge management practices 
*	skills management and transfer of knowledge

business functionality. These services can then be mixed and matched to
create entirely new applications or to deliver new business capabilities.
As a concept, SOA is not new. It is a product of the evolution of IT
architecture and distributed computing concepts. However, it has only become
a reality over the last few years because of the emergence of standards and
maturation of supporting technology. The Internet has played a significant
role in the evolution of these standards, allowing (Web) services to
interoperate globally within and across the boundaries of large and small
organizations. Without standards, it would be difficult for services to
communicate and interact with each other. Consequently, the aforementioned
sharing, reuse and combination of services to create business processes on
an as-needed basis would not be possible.
At its core, service orientation is about aligning technology to efficiently
and flexibly support the process and performance needs of the business.

Under conventional approaches to building IT systems, an application typically
supports a pre-defined set of business requirements (such as sales orders or
accounting). Whenever a new business need arises, organizations build or install
new applications. This is highly inefficient especially when the different
applications perform similar tasks and share the same data. Hence, SOA provides
both IT flexibility and business agility.
SOA is an industrial reality with projects and commercial offers. Moreover, related
advanced topics are numerous as : Cloud Computing, Grid, Green IT, Software as a
Service, Aspect Based Services, service based Multi Agent Systems ...
This first workshop on Recent  Trends  in SOA Based Information  Systems  provides
a forum for researchers and practitioners to present results, applications, and
experiences in software based on SOA and Web services. The organizing committee
welcomes high quality contributions that describe original and unpublished works
in the field of services-based application engineering in terms of design, development,
testing, and deployment, Enterprise Service Bus ...

SCOPE

With the rapid growth of the Internet as well as the increasing demand for broadband services, access networks have been receiving growing investments in recent years. This has led to a massive network deployment with the goal of eliminating the bandwidth bottleneck between end-users and the network core. Today many diverse technologies are being used to provide broadband access to end users. The architecture and performance of the access segment (local loop, wired and wireless access networks, and even home networks) are getting increasing attention for ensuring quality of service of diverse broadband applications. Moreover, most access lines will no longer terminate on a single device, thus leading to the necessity of having a home network designed for applications that transcend simple Internet access sharing among multiple personal computers and enable multimedia support. Therefore, the access network and its home portion have become a hot investment pool from both a financial as well as a research perspective.

The aim of the annual International Conference on Access Networks (ACCESSNETS) is to provide a forum that brings together scientists and researchers from academia, as well as managers and engineers from the industry and government organizations to meet and exchange ideas and recent work on all aspects of access networks and how they integrate with their in-home counterparts. ACCESSNETS 2010 is the fifth edition of this exciting event, which will be held in Budapest, Hungary, on 3-5 November 2010. The conference will consist of technical sessions, industry track, workshops and panels. The technical sessions will present original and fundamental research advances while the industry track, workshops and panels will focus on development, application and related business issues in this hot and exciting area.

SCOPE

Our society has entered an era where commercial activities, business transactions and government services have been, and more and more of them will be, conducted and offered over open networks such as the Internet. It has led to new opportunities for criminals and new challenges for law enforcement. For instance, Voice over IP raises significant challenges for call intercept and route tracing; information systems are becoming overwhelmingly large and the challenge of information source identification requires new sophisticated tools; consumer multimedia devices are increasingly becoming the tools to create potentially illegal content. At the same time, the scientific gathering and investigation of evidence at a crime scene push towards a variety of fascinating digital techniques.

Electronic telecommunications, information technology, consumer devices and sophisticated software are creating new opportunities for both criminals and forensic investigators. This conference aims to bring together the research contributions in the development of tools and techniques that assist in the investigation of potentially illegal activity associated with electronic communication and electronic devices. It will also investigative the practice and requirements for presentation of evidence in court. This might include the discovery, analysis, handling and storage of digital evidence, meeting the legal burden of proof, and the establishment of the forensic chain of evidence.

AIMS and TARGET AUDIENCE

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers involved in the construction and application of electronic dictionaries to discuss modifications of existing resources in line with the users' needs, thereby fully exploiting the advantages of the digital form. Given the breadth of the questions, we welcome reports on work from many perspectives, including but not limited to: computational lexicography, psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, language learning and ergonomics.


MOTIVATION

Whenever we read a book, write a letter or launch a query on a search engine, we always use words, the shorthand labels and concrete forms of abstract notions (concepts, ideas and more or less well specified thoughts). Yet, words are not only vehicles to express thoughts, they are also means to conceive them. They are mediators between language and thought, allowing us to move quickly from one idea to another, refining, expanding or illustrating our possibly underspecified thoughts. Only words have these unique capabilities, which is why they are so important.

Obviously, a good dictionary should contain many entries and a lot of information associated with each one of them. Yet, the quality of a dictionary depends not only on coverage, but also on accessibility of information. Access strategies vary with the task (text understanding vs. text production) and the knowledge available at the moment of consultation (word, concept, speech sounds). Unlike readers who look for meanings, writers start from them, searching for the corresponding words. While paper dictionaries are static, permitting only limited strategies for accessing information, their electronic counterparts promise dynamic, proactive search via multiple criteria (meaning, sound, related words) and via diverse access routes. Navigation takes place in a huge conceptual lexical space, and the results are displayable in a multitude of forms (e.g. as trees, as lists, as graphs, or sorted alphabetically, by topic, by frequency).

Many lexicographers work nowadays with huge digital corpora, using language technology to build and to maintain the lexicon. But access to the potential wealth of information in dictionaries remains limited for the common user. Yet, the new possibilities of electronic media in terms of comfort, speed and flexibility (multiple inputs, polyform outputs) are enormous. Computational resources are not prone to the same limitations as paperbound dictionaries. The latter were limited in scope, being confined to a specific task (translation, synonyms, ...) due to economical reasons, but this limitation is not justified anymore.

Today we can perform all tasks via one single resource, which may comprise a dictionary, a thesaurus and even more. The goal of this workshop is to perform the groundwork for the next generation of electronic dictionaries, that is, to study the possibility of integrating the different resources, as well as to explore the feasibility of taking the user's needs, knowledge and access strategies into account.


TOPICS

For this workshop we invite papers including but not limited to the following topics:

    Conceptual input of a dictionary user. What is in the authors' minds when they are generating a message and looking for a word? Do they start from partial definitions, i.e. underspecified input (bag of words), conceptual primitives, semantically related words, something akin to synsets, or something completely different? What does it take to bridge the gap between this input, incomplete as it may be, and the desired output (target word)?

    Organizing the lexicon and indexing words. Concepts, words and multi-word expressions can be organized and indexed in many ways, depending on the task and language type. For example, in Indo-European languages words are traditionally organized in alphabetical order, whereas in Chinese they are organized by semantic radicals and stroke counts. The way words and multi-word expressions are stored and organized affects indexing and access. Since knowledge states (i.e. knowledge available when initiating search) vary greatly and in unpredictable ways, indexing must allow for multiple ways of navigation and access. Hence the question: what organizational principles allow the greatest flexibility for access?

    NLP applications: Contributors can also demonstrate how such enhanced dictionaries, once embedded in existing NLP applications, can boost performance and help solve lexical and textual-entailment problems, such as those evaluated in SEMEVAL 2007, or, more generally, generation problems encountered in the context of summarization, question-answering, interactive paraphrasing or translation.



IMPORTANT DATES

        * Deadline for paper submissions: May 30, 2010
        * Notification of acceptance:  June 30, 2010
        * Camera-ready papers due: July 10, 2010
        * Cogalex workshop:  August 22, 2010



SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished work on any of the topic areas of the workshop. As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references revealing the authors' identity, should be avoided. Further details concerning the paper submission will be announced closer to the May 30 submission deadline.


RELATED CONFERENCES in BEIJING

Next to COLING 2010 there are two conferences workshop participants may be interested in:

    The 7th International Conference on Cognitive Science (ICCS) which takes place August 17 to 20, 2010, just before COLING. It is our hope that this unique opportunity will foster scientific exchange between the scientific communities of Computational Linguistics and Cognitive Science. The ICCS' venue is the China National Convention Center (CNCC) which is close to COLING's site, the Beijing International Convention Center (BICC), located on the other side of the China National Stadium ('Bird Nest').

AIMS AND SCOPE
-----------------------------

As model-driven engineering (MDE) spreads, disciplines like model transformation, domain specific languages (DSLs) and traceability become essential in order to support different kinds of models in an model-driven environment. Understanding the role of ontology technologies like knowledge representation, automated reasoning, dynamic classification and consistency checking in these fields is crucial to leverage the development of such disciplines. Thus, we highlight the following open questions: How can the scientific and technical results around ontologies, ontology languages and their corresponding reasoning technologies be used fruitfully in MDE? What is the role of ontologies in supporting model transformation or traceability? How can ontologies improve designing DSLs? Are current query languages able to query both kinds of models? 

Discussions about these and related questions will be supported by this workshop. TWOMDE2010 aims at providing a forum for discussing the application of different aspects of ontologies to enhance model-driven engineering.

The intended audience embraces members of the modeling community with experience or interest in model-driven engineering and in Knowledge Representation. Specifically, but not only, the participation of experts in technologies related with UML, MOF, ATL, QVT, RDF or OWL is highly welcome.


TOPICS OF INTEREST
-----------------------------

TWOMDE2010 is the exclusive forum at a MDE conference to address the application of ontologies in model-driven development. The potential of this field has just started being explored.

For this edition, we expect use cases in a wider range of topics. Topics of interest are but not exclusive:

  * RDF metamodel repository: interfaces and models to store, retrieve, query and manage MOF/Ecore metadata in RDF stores.

  * Reasoning over MOF-based models using ontologies: verification and validation of models using ontologies; application of Description Logics reasoning in UML diagrams or MOF/Ecore models, in order to enhance and to support models and metamodels at design time as well as at runtime.

  * Application of ontologies in model transformation: usage of ontologies and reasoning to automatically generate model transformations; validation of model transformations; use of reasoning in model transformation rules.

Miami, Florida, USA, held between July 5-10, 2010 in conjunction with ICWS 2010, SCC 2010, and CLOUD 2010
 
Aims and Scope

Mobile systems are characterized with autonomous, dynamically adaptable, and heterogeneous components collaborating in open intra-organizational environments to provide solutions. Next generation phones, mobile networks, mobile cloud computing are a few examples of mobile applications where code, users and their devices continuously move. Evolving requirements, such as reliability, security, scalability, performance and privacy, from fixed to mobile settings, has revealed new and important challenges. This is due to the behavioural constraints that mobility poses, and that were not faced in traditional distributed settings. Examples include: dynamic network topology, changes in location, constrained resource availability, communication protocols heterogeneity, unstable connectivity, and so forth. The service-oriented paradigm is a promising approach for engineering open, dynamic and distributed systems. There are a plethora of research issues on how mobile systems can make use of service oriented engineering techniques.

The EMSOS Workshop aims to bring together researchers from academia and industry, as well as practitioners in the area of engineering services in mobile environments in order to provide a forum where recent research results can be presented and discussed. The aim is to understand open issues in the software engineering area of services applied in mobile environments, and to build a community of researchers and practitioners willing to collaborate on these issues.

The workshop seeks contributions that address theoretical foundations, important issues, recent developments, applications, methods, practical techniques, tools, empirical studies, experience, and lessons learned related to engineering mobile service oriented systems.

Scope:
===================

The advances in wireless technologies and mobile devices have enabled 
the realization of a wide range of wireless networking opportunities. 
The coexistence of wireless heterogeneous networks has been widely 
recognized, and it has become more and more common that new mobile 
devices get equipped with multiple and heterogeneous wireless interfaces. 
Furthermore, the recent advances in software-defined and cognitive radio 
technologies promise even more diversity and heterogeneity. This brings 
about a lot of opportunities and challenges for mobile wireless networking.  
   
With the emerging wireless technologies, mobility has more generic 
meaning than just node movement as in the traditional sense. It also 
means that when the operational environment changes (such as frequency 
and power), a node or the network adapts to the environmental changes, 
which requires the cognitive capability. On one hand, it is of critical 
importance that seamless, low latency and transparent services are 
provided to the users, via potentially multiple heterogeneous wireless 
technologies or opportunistic spectrum access involved during the 
course of node movement or environmental changes. Environment cognizance, 
spectrum-aware mobility management, and vertical handoff become critical 
components in the solution space. On the other hand, host and network 
mobility also affects the performance of network protocols significantly, 
while at the same time allows opportunistic interconnections of heterogeneous 
networks, which in turn makes mobility adaptability an important design issue. 
This asks the design of wireless architectures, protocols, spectrum management, 
and mobility management mechanisms to be revisited. 

Cohesive with the main theme of Globecom 2010 --- ""moving into the age 
of mobile interactivity"", the workshop welcomes original submissions from 
both researchers and practitioners that explore recent advances in 
architecture, system, protocol, modeling, and testbed design, as well as 
emerging applications and standards to enable seamless mobility and 
transparency in wireless networks. Topics of interest include, but are 
not limited to:

- Architecture, system, and protocol design for seamless roaming support 
  in wireless networks

- Spectrum cognition and agility associated with mobility 

- Vertical handoff and seamless integration of heterogeneous networks

- Location tracking, positioning, and address management

- Mobility modeling and theoretical/experimental validation

- Mobility impact on routing, resource/power/QoS management

- Adaptive and resilient protocols for seamless mobility support at all layers, 
  as well as cross-layer approaches

- Security and privacy issues under mobility and network access

- Emerging standards and applications on mobility

- Simulation/testbed tools and experimental measurements

INTRODUCTION

The workshop builds upon the success of the first ACL ""The People's Web
meets NLP"" Workshop in 2009 that attracted 21 submissions. Accepted
submissions included papers on Wikipedia [1], Wiktionary [2], Mechanical
Turk [3], and game-based construction of semantic resources [4]. This
clearly demonstrates a substantial and growing interest of the NLP
community in collaboratively constructed semantic resources (CSRs),
also evidenced by the increasing number of publications in this area
and the EMNLP 2009 Web 2.0 track. In many works, CSRs have been used
to overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck and coverage problems
pertinent to conventional lexical semantic resources. The greatest
popularity in this respect can so far certainly be attributed to
Wikipedia [1]. However, other resources, such as folksonomies or the
multilingual collaboratively constructed dictionary Wiktionary, have
also shown great potential. Thus, the scope of the workshop deliberately
includes any collaboratively constructed resource, not only Wikipedia.

Effective deployment of CSRs to enhance NLP introduces a pressing need
to address a set of fundamental challenges, e.g. the interoperability
with existing resources, or the quality of the extracted lexical
semantic knowledge. Interoperability between resources is crucial as
no single resource provides perfect coverage. The quality of CSRs is
a fundamental issue, as they lack editorial control and entries are
often incomplete. Thus, techniques for link prediction [5] or
information extraction [6] have been proposed to guide the ""crowds""
while constructing resources of better quality.

TOPICS

The workshop will bring together researchers from different worlds, for
example those using collaboratively constructed resources as sources of
lexical semantic information for NLP purposes such as information
retrieval, named entity recognition, or keyword extraction, and those
using NLP techniques to improve the resources or extract and analyze
different types of lexical semantic information from them. We will
especially welcome contributions of interdisciplinary nature, e.g. those
applying discourse analysis techniques from computational linguistics to
the content of CSRs to better understand their properties.

Specific topics include but are not limited to:
 * Analysis of collaboratively constructed resources, such as wiki-based
   platforms, folksonomies, Twitter, or social networks;
 * Using collaboratively constructed resources for NLP purposes such
   as information retrieval, text categorization, information
   extraction, etc.;
 * Using special features of collaboratively constructed resources to
   create novel resource types, for example revision-based corpora,
   simplified versions of resources, etc.;
 * Analyzing the structure of collaboratively constructed resources
   related to their use in NLP;
 * Interoperability of collaboratively constructed resources with
   conventional lexical semantic resources and between themselves;
 * Mining social and collaborative content for constructing structured
   semantic resources and the corresponding tools;
 * Mining multilingual information from collaboratively constructed
   resources;
 * Quality and reliability of collaboratively constructed semantic
   resources. 

We especially encourage short papers describing publicly available tools
for accessing or analyzing collaboratively constructed resources that can
serve as a multiplier in the NLP community.

The workshop is intended to be highly interdisciplinary. Thus, we encourage
the participation of researchers working on computational linguistics
aspects (e.g. parsing or discourse analysis) or NLP applications (e.g.
information retrieval, information extraction, question answering, and
knowledge representation) as well as researchers from other areas who
might benefit from collaboratively constructed semantic resources.

Substantially extended versions of the best papers from the workshop can
be submitted to a planned Special Issue in one of the major computational
linguistics journals. The revised papers will have to undergo a separate
reviewing process required for journal publications.

Call for MT Research Papers at AMTA-2010

Contact: Hassan Sawaf (hassan (at) sawaf.de)

Machine Translation continues to be one of the most active research areas
within Natural Language Processing.  MT evaluations, such as those
conducted by NIST, provide ample evidence that the field of MT continues
to grow and attract more and more researchers.  Data-driven approaches
have become particularly fashionable in recent years.  These approaches
have generated systems that have been the top performers in recent
comparative evaluations.  Furthermore, the challenges of building
competitive MT systems have been significantly reduced with the
introduction of open source toolkits such as GIZA++ and MOSES.  This
development, exciting as it is, also bears the danger of introducing
uniformity into MT research.  AMTA aims to promote diversity in MT
research and actively seeks research papers across the entire range of the MT research spectrum for the AMTA-2010 research program.  We solicit
submissions in English of unpublished papers describing original research
on all aspects of Machine Translation.  We particularly encourage
submissions on topics related to the conference theme of MT applied within commercial translation settings.


Important dates:

- Notifications of acceptance:   Monday, July 5
- Final ""camera-ready"" versions: Monday, August 16


Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- Advances in data-driven MT (Statistical MT, Example-based MT, etc.)
- Advances in rule-based MT (Transfer-based MT, Interlingual MT, etc.)
- Lexicon and grammar acquisition and induction
- Hybrid approaches that integrate and unify aspects of rule-based MT and
 statistical MT
- MT for resource-poor languages

MT User Presentations:  Government Users and Translation Professionals

Contacts: Nick Bemish  ( Nicholas.Bemish@dia.mil )
       Chuck Simmons ( Charles.Simmons@wpafb.af.mil )


AMTA Government User presenters and participants will focus on the
strategic nature and use of Machine Translation in governmental
organizations.  Most governmental entities are providing a benefit to
their customers, who require them to translate large volumes of
information and to make it available across multiple languages and varied
network architectures.  The need for language translation technology
within governmental organizations is diverse and sometimes compartmented.
Governments are looking to advances in Machine Translation technology,
which help them deliver information not only from the native languages of various countries but also into those other languages.  In
turn, the information delivered helps the governments to understand social
and political activities in context.  In an age when significant volumes
of data are available in many languages, it is necessary to look to
automated alternatives, which assist the linguist and enable the human
translation process.

For this year's AMTA conference, we are asking government participants to
consider topics that address the strategic challenges of applying MT tools
and applications in their programs and processes.  We are looking for
representation from all government organizations that face language
challenges, including: Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human
Services, Human Resources, Commerce, Labor, Energy, Judiciary, Business,
Trade, Transportation, and many others.  Within the governmental
organizations we request the attendance of leaders or their
representatives, who can address challenging topics ranging among:

1.  Acquisition strategies that include policies directed towards      implementation of MT
2.  Funding priorities that stress the need for metrics to ensure adequate     return on investment (ROI)
3.  Requirements development which include a broad audience of users
   across the federal workspace
4.  Computer systems and network architectures that support inclusion of
   MT tools and any significant integration and security challenges
5.  Research and development leading to the advancement of tools that
   support less commonly used languages or minimizes gaps
6.  Program management strategies and how they apply to the integration
   and acceptance of MT tool usage
7.  Case studies on examples of MT use and how it impacts the
   organizations ability to share content
8.  Strategic views and objectives pertaining to challenges with respect
   to MT programs and the employment of MT tools (e.g., IT, personnel,
   implementation)
9.  Implementation strategies that factor into MT use as a process
   supporting human translation (pre-translation/post-editing)

The sessions will be structured to provide open and constructive dialogue
among attendees with diverse technical backgrounds and areas of expertise. A secondary objective of this approach is to establish longer-term
connections among participants and foster new cooperative efforts.


Important dates:

- Submissions due:                     Monday, June 28
- Notification of acceptance:          Monday, July 12
- Final ""camera-ready"" versions due:   Monday, August 16


What to submit:

Ideal proposals should include information on strategic views and
objectives pertaining to MT programs; employment of MT tools and
significant challenges; as well as information on achievable gains through usage and/or metrics.  Submissions should be 250-400 word summaries and
may be sent directly in e-mail or as attachments in RTF format.


How to submit:

Send submissions and questions to Government User program chairs, Nicholas Bemish at Nicholas.Bemish@dia.mil and Chuck Simmons at
Charles.Simmons@wpafb.af.mil  by Monday, June 28.

Call for Proposals for Workshops, Tutorials and Panels at AMTA-2010

Contact: George Foster ( george.foster@nrc.gc.ca )

AMTA 2010 is seeking proposals for workshops, tutorials and plenary panels
on all topics related to MT.  We particularly encourage proposals on
topics related to the conference theme of MT applied within commercial
translation settings.

Tutorials will be held on Sunday, October 31, immediately preceding the
main conference.  Workshops will be held on Thursday and Friday, November
4-5, immediately following the main conference.  Selected panels will be
an integral part of the main conference.


Aims:

Tutorials at AMTA conferences are a forum for experts in MT and MT-related areas to deliver concentrated training on a topic of interest in half-day
(or occasionally full-day) teaching sessions.  Tutorials provide
background that helps conference participants (especially newcomers to the field) understand the conference program, and/or enrich their
understanding of particular technical, applied, and business matters
surrounding research, development and use of MT and translation
technology.

AMTA workshops are intended to provide the opportunity for MT-related
communities of interest to spend focused time together advancing the state
of thinking or the state of practice in their area of interest or
endeavor.

Panel sessions within the main conference program provide an opportunity
for a select number of experts to provide their perspective and hold a
discussion on a concrete topic of interest or developing issue within the
field of MT.

Due to AMTA 2010's collocation with the ATA meeting, we are particularly
interested in proposals related to commercialization of MT and/or its use
by professional translators.  However, any themes connected to MT
research, development, deployment, use, and evaluation are welcome.


What to submit:

Proposals for workshops, tutorials and panel sessions should be submitted
by June 30, 2010 to George Foster (george.foster@nrc.gc.ca).  They should
include the proposed format (workshop, tutorial or panel), a title, a
one-page description of the proposed content, technical requirements and
the expected number of participants.  In the case of a workshop, the
proposal should also include dates for important milestones (call for
papers, recruitment of speakers, etc.), and whether this is an ongoing or
new workshop.  Workshop and Tutorial proposals must also include a signed
copy of the AMTA Workshop or Tutorial Policy and Leader Agreement Form. The appropriate forms will be posted on the conference web-page at:

Call for MT Research Papers at AMTA-2010

Contact: Hassan Sawaf (hassan (at) sawaf.de)

Machine Translation continues to be one of the most active research areas
within Natural Language Processing.  MT evaluations, such as those conducted
by NIST, provide ample evidence that the field of MT continues to grow and
attract more and more researchers.  Data-driven approaches have become
particularly fashionable in recent years.  These approaches have generated
systems that have been the top performers in recent comparative evaluations.
Furthermore, the challenges of building competitive MT systems have been
significantly reduced with the introduction of open source toolkits such as
GIZA++ and MOSES.  This development, exciting as it is, also bears the danger
of introducing uniformity into MT research.  AMTA aims to promote diversity in
MT research and actively seeks research papers across the entire range of the
MT research spectrum for the AMTA-2010 research program.  We solicit
submissions in English of unpublished papers describing original research on
all aspects of Machine Translation.  We particularly encourage submissions on
topics related to the conference theme of MT applied within commercial
translation settings.

MT User Presentations:  Government Users and Translation Professionals

Contacts: Nick Bemish  ( Nicholas.Bemish@dia.mil )
          Chuck Simmons ( Charles.Simmons@wpafb.af.mil )


AMTA Government User presenters and participants will focus on the strategic
nature and use of Machine Translation in governmental organizations.  Most
governmental entities are providing a benefit to their customers, who require
them to translate large volumes of information and to make it available across
multiple languages and varied network architectures.  The need for language
translation technology within governmental organizations is diverse and
sometimes compartmented.  Governments are looking to advances in Machine
Translation technology, which help them deliver information not only from the
native languages of various countries but also into those other languages.  In
turn, the information delivered helps the governments to understand social and
political activities in context.  In an age when significant volumes of data
are available in many languages, it is necessary to look to automated
alternatives, which assist the linguist and enable the human translation
process.

For this year's AMTA conference, we are asking government participants to
consider topics that address the strategic challenges of applying MT tools and
applications in their programs and processes.  We are looking for
representation from all government organizations that face language
challenges, including: Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services,
Human Resources, Commerce, Labor, Energy, Judiciary, Business, Trade,
Transportation, and many others.  Within the governmental organizations we
request the attendance of leaders or their representatives, who can address
challenging topics ranging among:

1.  Acquisition strategies that include policies directed towards 
    implementation of MT 
2.  Funding priorities that stress the need for metrics to ensure adequate
    return on investment (ROI) 
3.  Requirements development which include a broad audience of users across
    the federal workspace 
4.  Computer systems and network architectures that support inclusion of MT
    tools and any significant integration and security challenges 
5.  Research and development leading to the advancement of tools that support
    less commonly used languages or minimizes gaps 
6.  Program management strategies and how they apply to the integration and
    acceptance of MT tool usage 
7.  Case studies on examples of MT use and how it impacts the organizations
    ability to share content 
8.  Strategic views and objectives pertaining to challenges with respect to MT
    programs and the employment of MT tools (e.g., IT, personnel,
    implementation) 
9.  Implementation strategies that factor into MT use as a process supporting
    human translation (pre-translation/post-editing)

The sessions will be structured to provide open and constructive dialogue
among attendees with diverse technical backgrounds and areas of expertise.
A secondary objective of this approach is to establish longer-term
connections among participants and foster new cooperative efforts.


Important dates:

- Submissions due:                     Monday, June 28
- Notification of acceptance:          Monday, July 12
- Final ""camera-ready"" versions due:   Monday, August 16


What to submit:

Ideal proposals should include information on strategic views and objectives
pertaining to MT programs; employment of MT tools and significant challenges;
as well as information on achievable gains through usage and/or metrics.
Submissions should be 250-400 word summaries and may be sent directly in
e-mail or as attachments in RTF format.


How to submit:

Send submissions and questions to Government User program chairs, Nicholas
Bemish at Nicholas.Bemish@dia.mil and Chuck Simmons at
Charles.Simmons@wpafb.af.mil  by Monday, June 28.

Call for Proposals for Workshops, Tutorials and Panels at AMTA-2010

Contact: George Foster ( george.foster@nrc.gc.ca )

AMTA 2010 is seeking proposals for workshops, tutorials and plenary panels on
all topics related to MT.  We particularly encourage proposals on topics
related to the conference theme of MT applied within commercial translation
settings.

Tutorials will be held on Sunday, October 31, immediately preceding the main 
conference.  Workshops will be held on Thursday and Friday, November 4-5,
immediately following the main conference.  Selected panels will be an
integral part of the main conference.


Aims:

Tutorials at AMTA conferences are a forum for experts in MT and MT-related
areas to deliver concentrated training on a topic of interest in half-day (or
occasionally full-day) teaching sessions.  Tutorials provide background that
helps conference participants (especially newcomers to the field) understand
the conference program, and/or enrich their understanding of particular
technical, applied, and business matters surrounding research, development and
use of MT and translation technology.

AMTA workshops are intended to provide the opportunity for MT-related
communities of interest to spend focused time together advancing the state of
thinking or the state of practice in their area of interest or endeavor. 

Panel sessions within the main conference program provide an opportunity for a
select number of experts to provide their perspective and hold a discussion on
a concrete topic of interest or developing issue within the field of MT.

Due to AMTA 2010's collocation with the ATA meeting, we are particularly
interested in proposals related to commercialization of MT and/or its use by
professional translators.  However, any themes connected to MT research,
development, deployment, use, and evaluation are welcome.


What to submit:

Proposals for workshops, tutorials and panel sessions should be submitted by
June 30, 2010 to George Foster (george.foster@nrc.gc.ca).  They should include
the proposed format (workshop, tutorial or panel), a title, a one-page
description of the proposed content, technical requirements and the expected
number of participants.  In the case of a workshop, the proposal should also
include dates for important milestones (call for papers, recruitment of
speakers, etc.), and whether this is an ongoing or new workshop.  Workshop and
Tutorial proposals must also include a signed copy of the AMTA Workshop or
Tutorial Policy and Leader Agreement Form.  The appropriate forms will be
posted on the conference web-page at:

INTRODUCTION
Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) has emerged as a new computing paradigm for designing, building and using software applications to support business processes in heterogeneous, distributed and continuously changing environments. The architectural foundation for SOC is provided by the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), which states that applications expose their functionality as services in a uniform and technology-independent way such that they can be discovered and invoked over the network. Claimed benefits of SOC include cheaper and faster development of business applications through repeated aggregation of services, better reuse of software artifacts and legacy applications through service wrappings, and easier adaptation to changes in the business environment through replacement and reconfiguration of services.

In order to realize these benefits routinely with SOC, for realistic business settings with complex IT environments, many challenges still need to be addressed. For example, supporting business processes and collaborations in an open service-oriented world requires a better understanding of integration problems along different dimensions. First of all, alignment between business demands and application functions has to be achieved. This requirement for vertical integration should drive the aggregation of services, from basic IT services to rich business services, to achieve the desired or given business processes. Secondly, horizontal integration has to be considered if business collaborations span multiple organizations. In such cases, interoperability between the services has to be ensured at different levels (syntactic, semantic and pragmatic) and on different aspects (information and behavior). Thirdly, we have to assume that business demands as well as IT capabilities will change over time. This evolution will impact existing solutions, and thus require the adaptation, management and maintenance (e.g., versioning, replacing, updating) of services and service compositions. Moreover, changes that occur at one level or on one aspect have to be propagated to other levels and aspects in order to keep the consistency of the integration solution. And finally, all of the above challenges not only exist at design-time, but at run-time as well. Service composition may be on-demand, driven by an end-user service creation activity, and running instances of composite services are subject to changes concerning, for instance, the availability of resources. This implies that service level agreements and associated quality-of-service need to be negotiated, monitored, and controlled in multi-party and heterogeneous environments.

GOAL AND TOPICS
The goal of the workshop is to focus on the fundamental and practical challenges related to SOC, to discuss what theoretical, architectural or technology foundation is needed, and how this foundation can be supported or realized by new or enhanced infrastructures, standards and/or technologies. The workshop aims at contributing to the dissemination of research results, establishment of a better understanding, and identification of new challenges related to SOC/SOA, by bringing together interested academic and industrial researchers. 

Topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

Service foundation and design issues
	- principles of SOC/SOA, service science

LREC 2010 Workshop on Web Logs and Question Answering

Valletta, Malta, Saturday 22nd May 2010

www.csis.ul.ie/wlqa2010

Submission deadline: 12th February 2010

Motivation & Scope
==================

An Information Retrieval system takes a user query and returns a ranked list
of documents. On the other hand, a Question Answering system provides an
exact answer [1]. There has been quite a long period of research in factoid
QA driven by annual tracks at CLEF [2], TREC [3] and NTCIR [4]. The result
of this work has been that it is possible to construct systems which can
answer simple factoid queries with high accuracy. This has led to the belief
that QA is a ""solved problem"" where no more research is required. However,
the questions are not usually from real users, they are devised by the
assessors at CLEF, TREC etc. Secondly, they are restricted to certain
well-known simple types which are only a small subset of the real questions
which people wish to ask. Thirdly, questions are considered in isolation (or
in some tracks a fixed group) and not in a dialogue context whereas in our
interactions with people all questions are answered in context and with the
possibility for clarification. Thus, there is a need to inject new ideas
into QA research.

Recently there has been much interest in Web query logs and in particular
methods for analysing these in order to extract information which can be
used to improve IR systems [5,6]. Logs are typically extremely large and
contain naturally occurring and noisy data. Automatic techniques (using for
example statistical approaches or machine learning algorithms) are therefore
necessary since manual approaches are not generally feasible.

The purpose of the workshop, therefore, is to investigate how some of the
methods developed for analysing web logs within an implicit IR context can
be applied to QA. For example:

* Can the meaning of IR queries in logs be deduced automatically in order to
extract the corresponding questions from them?

* Can NLP techniques developed within QA, e.g. Named Entity recognition be
applied to the analysis of query logs?

* Can logs be used to deduce useful new forms of question (i.e. not simple
factoids) which could be looked at next by QA researchers?

* Can questions grouped into sessions be comprehended in such a way as to
deduce the underlying implicit natural language dialogue consisting of a
coherent sequence of questions where each follows logically from both the
previous ones and the system's responses to them?

* Are there logs from real (or experimental) QA systems like lexxe.com which
can be obtained and what can be learned from them from the perspective of
designing evaluation tasks? What about logs from sites like answers.com
(where queries are answered by human respondents)?

* Are QA query logs different from IR query logs? Do users behave
differently in QA systems? Can QA-style questions be identified within an IR
log?

* Can click-through data - where the aim of a question can be inferred from
the returned documents which are inspected - be used for the development of
QA systems for example for the deduction of important query types and their
links to IR queries?

* Are there logs of transcribed speech made from telephone QA systems which
can be obtained and what analysis could be carried out on those, using for
example techniques developed at related tracks at CLEF such as
Cross-Language Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) and Question Answering on Script
Transcription (QAST)?

Historically, QA was a combination of NLP and IR. Much web log analysis is a
form of IR in which the same problem of retrieval is being approached from a
different direction, namely the queries themselves. Thus we are proposing
here a new combination, namely QA and log analysis. These fields are
complementary and share the goal of building better systems for users.

The wide and increasing needs of adaptable and flexible solutions for many industrial, environmental, and engineering applications point out the importance of using design methodologies and implementation technologies with high ability of adaptation and evolution.  Soft computing is one of the most relevant answers to such needs: neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic/evolutionary algorithms are fundamental keys to tackle these difficult problems.  On the other hand, accuracy and uncertainty issues as well as suited data acquisition systems must be carefully considered in these applications since the quality of the solution greatly relies on them.  Up to now, analysis and experiments have been performed by scientists and practitioners mainly to understand the underlying technologies and methodologies, but without any specific focus on the mandatory need of a quantitative assessment and a metrological analysis.  Measurement science and technologies are in fact vital to ensure the correct and effective use of soft computing technologies in real environments.  CIMSA 2010 will continue the exciting experience of the previous editions by filling this gap in knowledge and practice, by focusing on the quantitative aspect of measurement issues for industrial, environmental, and engineering applications.

Papers are solicited on all aspects of computational intelligence technologies for measurement systems and the related applications, from the points of view of both theory and practice.  This includes but is not limited to: intelligent measurement systems; accuracy and precision of neural and fuzzy components; intelligent sensor fusion; intelligent monitoring and control systems; neural and fuzzy technologies for identification, prediction, and control of complex dynamic systems; evolutionary monitoring and control; neural and fuzzy signal/image processing for industrial and environmental applications; image understanding and recognition; soft-computing technologies for robotics and vision; soft computing technologies for medical and bioengineering applications; hybrid systems; fuzzy and neural components for embedded systems; hardware implementation of neural and fuzzy systems for measurements; neural, fuzzy and genetic/evolutionary algorithms for system optimization and calibration; neural and fuzzy diagnosis of components and systems; reliability of fuzzy and neural components; fault tolerance and testing in fuzzy and neural components; neural and fuzzy techniques for quality measurement.

Workshop Goals

The Computational Linguistics - Applications Workshop was created in 2008 in response to the fast-paced progress in the area.

Traditionally, computational linguistics was limited to the scientists specialized in the processing of a natural language by computers. Scientific approaches and practical techniques come from linguistics, computer science, psychology, and mathematics. Nowadays, there is a number of practical applications available. These applications are sometimes developed by smart yet NLP-untrained developers who solve the problems using sophisticated heuristics.

Computational Linguistics needs to be applied to make the full use of the Internet. There is a definite need for software that can handle unstructured text to allow search for information on the web. According to the European Commission, Human Language Technologies are one of the key research areas for the upcoming years. The priority aim of the research in this area is to enable users to communicate with the computer in their native language.

CLA'10 Workshop is a place where the parties meet to exchange views and ideas with a benefit to all involved. The Workshop will focus on practical outcome of modeling human language use and the applications needed to improve human-machine interaction.
Paper Topics

This call is for papers that present research and developments on all aspects of Natural Language Processing used in real-life applications, such as (this list is not exhaustive):

    * information retrieval
    * extraction of linguistic knowledge from text corpora
    * semantic ontologies in computer linguistics
    * lexical resources
    * machine translation and translation aids
    * ambiguity resolution

Paper Presentation

The presentation of the paper has to include a demonstration of an existing tool. The papers should include a section describing the tool (or a prototype), which demonstrates the theory discussed in the paper.

The presentation is divided into two parts. First, the author(s) shortly demonstrate their tools to the audience. In the second part, the authors discuss their work with other participants and let the audience test their software.

Papers will be evaluated and accepted on the basis of their technical merit, usefulness of the real life application and relevance to the workshop scope by the CLA'10 Program Committee. The paper will be assessed by academics as well as industry representatives in order to assure fair and balanced assessment.

All accepted and presented papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings and included in the IEEE Xplore database. The best demonstrations will be selected to be shown to the general audience of the conference at a plenary session.
Papers Submission

 

    * Authors should submit draft papers (as Postscript, PDF of MSWord file).
    * The total length of a paper should not exceed 8 pages (IEEE style). IEEE style templates will be available ASAP.

CLA '09 post conference report

It seems that the motto of our workshop ""Show the system in action"" has been accepted by the NLP community. This year 33 papers were submitted (90% increase from last year); 19 of them were accepted by the programming committee. 15 papers were presented during the workshop - our guests from Iran or Tunisia seemingly found Poland too far away from their homelands. Still, 11 countries were represented in the workshop, mainly from the Western Europe.

The workshop was composed of oral presentations and the demo-poster session. Presentations, given on Tuesday (October, 12th), were divided into three sessions:

   1. Information Retrieval,
   2. Use of NLP Tools In practical application,
   3. Parsing issues; Linguistic resources.


In the evening the audience voted for the best presentations of each of the session as well as the best overall performance. The voters used their mobile phones and the result were known immediately - to the chairman. The winners were presented officially at the Gala Ceremony (In the Oscar Ceremony fashion). The Information Retrieval session was one by Igor Leturia from Spain - or rather his virtual agent who could fluently answer any question posed in the Basque language. The session on Practical Applications was won by Eric Wehrli from Switzerland and his micro-scanner that read German texts and translated them into English. Parsing issues were best presented by charming Katarzyna Moroz from Poznan (Poland) who convinced the audience that her new parsing algorithm using pregroup grammars will soon outperform existing ones. And finally, after the three nominees had been presented, the Oscar went to...Spain.

The demo-poster session took place on Wednesday morning. It looked as if the participants had not celebrated too long into the Tuesday night - at 9 a.m. almost all of them were ready to put their applications under the pressure of real tests. Well, the winner did not understand the chairman's Basque too well... she obviously preferred her master, Igor.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Authors are invited to submit a full paper not exceeding 8 pages
formatted in the LNCS style (see below). Those accepted will be
presented either orally or as posters. The decision about the
presentation format will be based on the recommendation of the
reviewers. The authors are asked to submit their papers using the
on-line form accessible from the conference website.

Papers submitted to TSD 2008 must not be under review by any other
conference or publication during the TSD review cycle, and must not be
previously published or accepted for publication elsewhere.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."",
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ..."".  Papers that do not conform to the
requirements above are subject to be rejected without review.

The authors are strongly encouraged to write their papers in TeX
or LaTeX formats. These formats are necessary for the final
versions of the papers that will be published in the Springer
Lecture Notes.  Authors using a WORD compatible software for the
final version must use the LNCS template for WORD and within the
submit process ask the Proceedings Editors to convert the paper
to LaTeX format.  For this service a service-and-license fee of
CZK 1500 will be levied automatically.

The paper format for review has to be either PDF or PostScript file
with all required fonts included. Upon notification of acceptance,
presenters will receive further information on submitting their
camera-ready and electronic sources (for detailed instructions on
the final paper format see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html#Proceedings.)

FOCUS
-----
The workshop aims at clarifying the role of workflow technology in accelerating science, by providing effective means to automate data management tasks on a large scale. Thus, it sits at the intersection between process management for scientific applications, and data management. 
A number of innovative, but uncoordinated, efforts in data-centric workflows have made their mark on the scientific and business world in recent years. The goal of this workshop is to use these efforts to start bringing together a research community around the theoretical foundations,  technology development,  and domain applications of workflow systems in the context of large-scale data management for science.

In this spirit, we seek contributions from both researchers and practitioners on all aspects of data and process management that contribute towards this goal. More specifically, relevant topics include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Role of workfows in data analytics, mining and statistics 
- Performance estimation and optimization of workflow execution
- Scalability of workflow-based solutions on very large data sets
- Role of metadata in static profiling of dataflows
- Impact of, and new requirements for, workflow technology on open science
- Workflow warehousing, indexing, searching, and mining 
- Workflows for service orchestration
- Mapping workflows to cloud computing environments
- In-database workflow execution
- User interaction models for complex eScience: visibility vs. commoditization
- Workflow repurposing and reuse
- Privacy models for data-centric workflows
- Workflow semantics
- Workflows as invisible middleware
- Workflows in Service-oriented life sciences
- Component-based business intelligence
- Sensor data processing
- Data integration and provenance tracking in medical research

Motivation
++++++++++

During the last years, researchers and practitioners of the Semantic Web
have progressively consolidated a number of very important achievements.
Formal languages have been standardized to define ontology-based knowledge
representations, logic formalisms and query models. Ontology engineering
methodologies and tools have been proposed to ease the designing and
populating of ontological knowledge bases. Reasoning engines have been
implemented to exploit inference capabilities of ontologies, and
semantic-based frameworks have been built to enrich the functionalities of
Web services. These achievements are the pillars to deal with the complex
challenge of bringing semantics to the Web.

The above gives a new ground to extend the focus of the Semantic Web by
engaging it in other communities, where semantics can play an important
role. The available semantic knowledge bases can be used to enrich and link
additional repositories, ontology engineering techniques can be utilized to
properly design and build ontologies in further real-world domains, and
inference and query mechanisms can enhance classic information management
and retrieval approaches.

Among these communities, this workshop aims to attract the attention of
students and professionals both from academia and industry who take benefit
of semantic-based techniques and technologies in within-application
Adaptation, Personalization and Recommendation approaches. In parallel to
the progress made in the Semantic Web research topics, there have been
appearing works in the above areas that use ontologies to model the userÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s
preferences, tastes and interests, and exploit these personal features
together with meta-information about multimedia contents in order to provide
the user with adaptation and personalization capabilities for different
purposes such as information retrieval and item recommendation.

Moreover, with the advent of the Web 2.0 (also called the Social Web), the
potential study and development of those approaches have increased
exponentially. Social networks allow people to provide explicit
relationships with others, and find out implicit user similarities based on
their profiles. Social tagging services offer the opportunity to easily
create and exploit personal knowledge representations. Wiki-style sites
represent an environment where the community contributes and shares
information, and blogs are media in which users express subjective opinions.
In all of these scenarios, adaptation, personalization and recommendation
are core functionalities. However, the understanding and exploitation of the
semantics underlying user and item profiles are still open issues.

++++++++++++++++++
Topics of interest
++++++++++++++++++

The workshop will focus on establishing user/usage models for adaptation,
personalization and recommendation approaches for the Social-semantic Web.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the exploitation of the
Web of Data, the identification of semantics underlying social annotations
of multimedia contents, and the application of semantic-based techniques and
technologies in research fields related to:

   * Personalized access to multimedia content
   * Content-based recommendation and collaborative filtering
   * Adaptive exploration of multimedia content
   * Adaptive user interfaces for multimedia content browsing and searching
   * Community extraction and exploitation
   * Social networks analysis for collaborative recommendation
   * User profile construction based on social tagging information
   * Context-aware multimedia content access and delivery
   * Mobile and ubiquitous multimedia content access and delivery
