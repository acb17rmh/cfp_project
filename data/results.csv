   IEEE Workshop on Pervasive Group Communication @ IEEE GLOBECOM 2010

                URL: http://pergroup.realmv6.org

                Miami, FL, USA, December 6, 2010,

            held in conjunction with IEEE GLOBECOM 2010,

            and co-sponsored by IEEE HCCTC sub-committee,
            G-Lab, and The unbelievable Machine Company

Group communications have passed from research to deployment and back to a
research issue. Newly deployed services, in particular IPTV, P2P content
distribution, and collaborative applications, are stimulating current research
on multicast, broadcast, concast, and anycast. Emerging design issues for a
future multi-service Internet combined with the dynamic development of wireless
access techonologies challenge the community to rethink the position of group
communications along the stack.

The PerGroup workshop invites the community to share efforts in search of
seamless, pervasive group services, and to discuss directions on a
human-centric multi-service Inter-networking architecture. We welcome
contributions that design new solutions or analyze existing deployments, but
also those that present striking problem statements or early conceptual work.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

System Design & Methodology:
  - Architectures and protocols for fixed, wireless and ad hoc networks
  - Protocols and interfaces for intuitive group communications
  - Intra- and Inter-domain group communication
  - Native, overlay (including P2P) and hybrid multicast
  - Topology analysis & measuring, mining and modeling of 
  - media-rich social networks
  - Measurement, simulation and analytical studies as well as deployment
    experiences

Supporting Technologies:
  - Multipath routing / extension of emerging routing schemes
  - Cooperative relaying and network coding
  - Service placement and service location
  - Security and privacy issues for multicast, anycast, and broadcast
  - Real-time and QoS aspects

Applications:
  - Adaptive content distribution, e.g., video broadcasting
  - Application-layer traffic optimization and provider interaction
  - Multicast & anycast in a future multi-service Internet
  - New data distribution models to facilitate group communication
  - Frameworks for human centric based group communications

Good decision-making is dependent on comprehensive, accurate
knowledge.  But the information relevant to many important decisions
in areas such as business, government, medicine and scientific
research is massive, and growing at an accelerating pace.  Relevant
raw data is widely available on the web and other data sources, but
usually in order to be useful it must be gathered, extracted,
organized, and normalized into a knowledge base.

Hand-built knowledge bases such as Wikipedia have made us all better
decision-makers.  However more than human editing will be necessary to
create a wide variety of domain-specific, deeply comprehensive,
more highly structured knowledge bases.

A variety of automated methods have begun to reach levels of accuracy
and scalability that make them applicable to automatically
constructing useful knowledge bases from text and other sources.
These capabilities have been enabled by research in areas including
natural language processing, information extraction, information
integration, databases, search and machine learning.  There are
substantial scientific and engineering challenges in advancing and
integrating such relevant methodologies.

This workshop will gather researchers in a variety of fields that
contribute to the automated construction of knowledge bases.

There has recently been a tremendous amount of new work in this area,
some of it in traditionally disconnected communities.  In this
workshop the organizers aim to bring these communities together.


Topics of interest include:

* information extraction; open information extraction,
   named entity extraction; entity resolution, relation extraction.
* information integration; schema alignment; ontology alignment;
   ontology constrution.
* monolingual alignment, alignment between knowlege bases and text.
* joint inference between text interpretation and knowledge base
   pattern analysis, semantic analysis of natural language,
   reading the web, learning by reading.
* databases; distributed information systems; probabilistic
   databases.
* scalable computation; distributed computation.
* information retrieval; search on mixtures of structured and
   unstructured data; querying under uncertainty.
* machine learning; unsupervised, lightly-supervised and
   distantly-supervised learning; learning from naturally-available
   data.
* human-computer collaboration in knowledge base construction;
   automated population of wikis.
* dynamic data, online/on-the-fly adaptation of knowledge.
* inference; scalable approximate inference.
* languages, toolkits and systems for automated knowledge base
   construction.
* demonstrations of existing automatically-built knowledge bases.

CALL FOR PAPERS

The fourth annual North-Eastern Student Colloquium on Artificial Intelligence (NESCAI) will be hosted at University of Massachusetts Amherst (Amherst, MA) on April 16-18. Students are encouraged to submit papers describing new or previously submitted research and ideas in all areas of AI (see partial list below). The primary author on each submitted paper must be a student attending a school in the northeastern United States or eastern Canada. Due to generous sponsorship, a small $50 registration fee covers conference costs and two nights of accommodation. The conference website can be found at http://nescai.cs.umass.edu.

NESCAI is the premier student colloquium on AI, bringing together students from all areas of Artificial Intelligence research. The colloquium hosts students from the Northeastern U.S. and Eastern Canada and aims to foster an exchange of ideas, discussions and networking. NESCAI is sponsored by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Yahoo Inc.

Important Dates:

    * Paper Submission for Review: 1 March 2010
    * Reviewer Responses and Acceptance Decision: 22 March 2010
    * Final Revision of Accepted Papers: 5 April 2010 

Submission Details: We welcome both full and short papers. All accepted papers will be presented at a poster session and selected full papers will be accepted for talks.

FULL PAPERS (8 pages): Appendices may exceed the eight-page limit, but the reviewers are under no obligation to read any material beyond the page limit. Full papers may be:

    * Research papers presenting previously submitted or novel research in AI
    * Conceptual papers presenting and motivating new ideas and research directions in AI
    * Survey papers summarizing the state of the art in a particular sub-field of AI 

SHORT PAPERS (2 pages): Short papers may be:

    * Research abstracts
    * Progress reports on ongoing research 

All submissions will be peer-reviewed using a double-blind system by at least two graduate students in the respective areas. We encourage the resubmission of both previously and currently submitted papers, as long as this is indicated by the author. We will work with authors to ensure that copyrights held by other conferences will not be violated but we do not anticipate any problems, as there will be no formal publication of NESCAI proceedings.

All papers accepted by NESCAI (including those accepted as oral presentations) will also be presented as posters during one of the poster sessions. It is expected that all papers will be accepted for poster presentation, with only a select few being chosen for talks (based on peer reviews).

Background

CLEF2010 is the continuation of the popular CLEF campaigns that have run for
the past ten years. It will cover a broad range of issues in the fields of
multilingual and multimodal information access evaluation. It will consist
of two main parts: a peer-reviewed conference (20-21 September) on
experimental evaluation, which will innovate the CLEF tradition, and a
series of labs (22-23 September), which will continue the CLEF tradition of
community-based evaluation and discussion on evaluation issues.


Aim and Scope

The CLEF2010 conference aims at advancing the evaluation of complex
multimodal and multilingual information systems in order to support
individuals, organizations, and communities who design, develop, employ, and
improve such systems.

The growth of the Internet has been exponential with respect to the number
of users, media, and languages used regularly for global information
dissemination. Language and media barriers are no longer seen as inviolable
and they are constantly crossed and mixed to provide content that can be
accessed on a global scale within a multicultural and multilingual setting.

Users need to be able to co-operate and communicate across language and
media boundaries, going beyond separate search in diverse media/languages
and exploiting interactions between different languages and media.

Experimental evaluation - both laboratory and interactive - is a key to
fostering the development of multilingual and multimodal information systems
that address increasingly complex information needs.

The CLEF2010 labs will continue the CLEF tradition of community-based
benchmarking and will complement these with workshops on emerging issues in
evaluation methodology. Lab proposals were sollicited at an earlier stage

The Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Practical Issues in Building Sensor Network Applications
Calling for papers

Introduction:
Sensor nodes are tiny autonomous devices that combine sensing, computing and wireless communication capabilities. These nodes are deeply embedded into the physical surroundings, and gather and process information such as temperature, humidity, light characteristics, seismic activities or images and sound samples from the physical world. Networked systems of such sensors are expected to be used in a variety of applications including habitat monitoring, precision agriculture, disaster recovery operations, healthcare and supply chain management. Real world sensor network deployments and prototype implementations are still not commonplace. However, experiences gained in such deployments are crucial for the sensor network research community. These results will allow us to refine assumptions made when designing hardware, software, protocols and mechanisms for sensor networks.

SenseApp 2010, the Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Practical Issues in Building Sensor Network Applications, will be a one-day workshop, held in conjunction with the IEEE Conference on Local Comupter Networks (LCN 2010). The workshop aims at bringing together researchers from academia and industry to showcase their work and obtain feedback. We expect the workshop to act as a forum for the sensor network research community to discuss open issues, novel solutions and the future development of wireless sensor networks in general.

Scope:
Authors are invited to submit original unpublished work, not currently under review by another conference, workshop or journal. Full papers should be restricted to 8 camera-ready pages (in 10 pt font, double column, US letter size, 8.5 x 11 inches, IEEE format) including text, figures and references. Poster papers are an opportunity to present initial results and obtain feedback on on-going research. We also welcome submissions for demonstrations that showcase original research, practical implementations and realistic applications of wireless sensor networks. Poster/demo papers must be restricted to 2 camera-ready pages. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Experiences from real-world sensor network deployment and applications
Innovative sensor network applications
Middleware support for sensor networks
Programming and debugging sensor networks
Security, availability and dependability issues in sensor networks
Practical problems in implementing localization and time synchronization
Experiences with communication protocols
Practical medium access control protocols (MACs)
Topology control and routing protocols in existing sensor network deployments
Antenna design and experiences with signal propagation
Experiences regarding energy management and network lifetime
Fault-tolerance and troubleshooting sensor networks
Management of large-scale sensor networks
Interconnection between IP and sensor networks
Hardware design and operating systems issues

The 4th International Workshop on
Large Scale Distributed Systems and Middleware

Zurich, Switzerland, 28-29 July 2010
Held in conjunction with PODC
In cooperation with SIGOPS pending approval

http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/ladis2010

ABOUT THE WORKSHOP

LADIS 2010 will bring together researchers and practitioners in the
fields of distributed systems and middleware to discuss the
challenges of building massive distributed computing systems and
clouds. By posing research questions in the context of the largest
and most-demanding real-world systems, LADIS serves to catalyze
dialog between cloud computing engineers and scalable distributed
systems researchers, to open the veil of secrecy that has surrounded
many cloud computing architectures, and to increase the potential
impact of the best research underway in both the systems and theory
communities.

Due to the co-location with PODC, this year's LADIS will devote
special attention to promoting exchange of ideas between the theory
and systems communities on the topics related to design,
implementation, performance and underlying principles of large-scale
distributed systems and cloud computing.

This workshop invites work and promotes the exchange of ideas in the
following topics:

- Consistency, reliability and fault-tolerance models for cloud
  computing infrastructures and the technologies to support them
  (e.g. convergent consistency, transactions, state-machine
  replication).

- Novel storage organizations for large scale systems (e.g., no-SQL
  databases or key-value storage), snapshot and weak isolation
  models, scalable and elastic transaction approaches
  (e.g. mini-transactions), wide-area transactions.

- Large-scale infrastructure technologies (e.g. Chubby, Paxos,
  Zookeeper, group membership services, distributed registries).

- Support and programming models for scalable cloud-hosted
  applications and services (e.g. map-reduce, global file systems,
  pub-sub, multicast, group communication).

- Power and other resource management tools (e.g. virtualization and
  consolidation, resource allocation, load balancing, resource
  placement, routing, scheduling).

- Privacy tools and models (e.g. digital identity management,
  encrypting private data in the cloud, information flow in data
  centers).

Particular attention is given to challenges unique to the
large-scale distributed systems and cloud computing domains.

The workshop will last for a day and a half, which will include a
mix of presentation of accepted papers and as well as keynotes from
prominent industry speakers who have been there, made key decisions,
and can talk about the architectures of the world's most demanding
cloud platforms.

Previous LADIS keynote and invited speakers include Gennaro Cuomo
(CTO, IBM WebSphere), Jeff Dean (Google Fellow), James Hamilton
(technology guru for Microsoft's Cloud Computing initiative, now at
Amazon), David Nichols (Microsoft Windows Live), Raghu Ramakrishnan
(Yahoo! Fellow), Ben Reed (developer of Yahoo's Zookeeper), Marvin
Theimer (Principal Engineer at Amazon), Franco Travostino and Randy
Shoup (CTO and Chief Architect for eBay).

SUBMISSION AND LOGISTICS

To attend, you are invited to submit a position or short research
paper expressing new ideas, research directions, or relevant
opinions. Submissions consist of up to 5 pages using 11-point Times
Roman font, including title page with author names, and
bibliography. Submissions deviating from these guidelines will not
be reviewed. Submissions will be judged on originality, clarity,
relevance, and, above all, their likelihood of generating
discussion. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital
Library.

============================================================
Second INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP on 
Collaborative Agents -- REsearch and Development (CARE) 2010
31st August 2010, York University, Toronto, Canada

Abstract submission: April 14, 2010
Full paper submission: April 16, 2010

http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~xtg/CARE2010/
============================================================

The workshop is held in conjunction with the International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT).
http://www.yorku.ca/wiiat10/

Summary
=======

Collaboration is required when multiple agents achieve complex goals that are difficult or impossible to attain for an individual agent. This collaboration takes place under conditions of incomplete information, uncertainty, and bounded rationality, much of which has been previously studied in economics and artificial intelligence. However, many real world domains are characterised by even greater complexity, including the possibility of unreliable and non-complying collaborators, complex market and incentive frameworks, and complex transaction costs and organisational structures. This workshop's thematic focus is on collaborative and autonomous agents that plan, negotiate, coordinate, and act under this complexity.
 
This workshop aims to foster discussions on computational models of collaboration in distributed systems, addressing a range of theoretical and practical issues. We seek contributions of members in research and industry that use the agent paradigm to approach their problems.
 
Some issues of interest of this workshop are:
o How to enable agents to form and follow joint agreements and contracts in complex organisational and market driven domains.
o How to develop a comprehensive contractual formation/maintenance framework applicable to many application domains.
o How to build comprehensive customer lifecycle management systems for customers, including telecommunication consumers, students and patients.
o How to deploy lifecycle management systems in real world applications, such as healthcare, telecommunication, and smart campuses.
o How to design markets that are adequate for agents to act with incomplete and uncertain information of the behaviour of collaborating agents. 
o How to build MAS that work efficiently in partially regulated markets (where governance policy or partnership agreements govern part of the market).
o What are the implications of partial regulation on the management of contractual relationships and service delivery.
o How organisational structures influence the negotiation of agents and the distribution/execution of tasks.
o How to cope with collaborators that exhibit unreliable and non-conformant behaviour, eg where agreements are made but are not always conformed with.
o How can interventions and incentive structures assist in managing contractual relationships and service delivery.
o How to assign transaction costs to actions in planning, assignment, and execution in organisational structures. 
o How can transaction costs influence the social outcome of the system which is further influenced by the organisational context under which the collaboration takes place. 
o Can lessons learnt in game theoretic computation inform collaborative agent settings.
o What role does learning and adaptivity play in building organisational MAS.

The one day workshop will feature a mixture of invited talks, discussions and submitted contributions describing current work or work in progress in collaborative agent research and technology. The workshop environment fosters open discussions among all participants, particularly encouraging students to discuss their research topics and seek feedback from senior agent researchers.

IEEE GLOBECOM 2010 Next-Generation Networking (NGN) Symposium
December 6-10, 2010, Miami, Florida, USA

Scope and Motivation

Networking technologies have experienced profound levels of advancement
over the last three decades. These evolutions have come about as a
result of relentless research and development efforts across all layers
of the network hierarchy. As these advances continue to transform our
everyday lives, many new challenges and opportunities are emerging in
the broader area of ""next-generation networking"". In particular, some of
the key focus areas include network heterogeneity, scalability,
virtualization, services and applications, security, manageability,
dependability, and performance predictability. Moreover, the
next-generation wireless networks are introducing even more niche
problems in mobility management, content distribution, and
self-organization. 

Along these lines, the planned Next-Generation
Networking (NGN) Symposium at IEEE GLOBECOM 2010 will hope to address
many of these exciting new focus areas. This symposium will solicit
participation from both academic and industry researchers working in the
area of next-generation networking technologies, services,
architectures, and protocols. The overall goal here will be to present a

Fourth International Workshop on Trustworthy Ubiquitous Computing
 (TwUC 2010)

November 8-10, 2010, Paris, France

http://www.twuc.info
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fourth International Workshop on the vision of a trustworthy
ubiquitous computing will be held on November 8-10, 2010, in Paris,
France. The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 12th
international conference on Advances in Mobile Multimedia (iiWAS2010)
and the 8thInternational Conference on Advances in Mobile Computing &
Multimedia (MoMM2010). TwUC covers aspects of trust in ubiquitous
computing environments. The aspects of context, privacy, reliability,
usability and user experience related to ubiquitous computing
environments represent the main topics of the workshop.

Marc Weiser presented his vision of disappearing and ubiquitous
computing more than 15 years ago. The big picture of the computer
introduced into our environment was a big innovation and the starting
point for various areas of research. In order to totally adopt the idea
of ubiquitous computing several houses were build, equipped with
technology and used as laboratory in order to find and test appliances
that are useful and could be made available in our everyday life.
Within the last years industry picked up the idea of integrating
ubiquitous computing and already available products like remote
controls for your house were developed and brought to the marked.

In spite of many applications and projects in the area of ubiquitous
and pervasive computing the success is still far away. One of the main
reasons is the lack of acceptance of and confidence in this technology.
Although researchers and industry are working in all of these areas a
forum to elaborate security, reliability and privacy issues, that
resolve in trustworthy interfaces and computing environments for people
interacting within these ubiquitous environments is important. The user
experience factor of trust thus becomes a crucial issue for the success
of a UbiComp application.

The goal of the TwUC 2010 workshop is to provide an international forum
for scientists, engineers and industry to address recent research
results and to present and discuss their ideas, theories, technologies,
systems, tools, applications, work in progress and experiences on all
theoretical and practical issues.

Topics of Interest The conference program will include peer reviewed
full papers around but not limited to the following topics:

- Usability and HCI in Ubiquitous Computing Environments
	- Methods and concepts to enhance and ensure usability in 
	  UbiComp environments User experience in ubiquitous environ-

RNDM 2010 is the second meeting in the series of RNDM workshops. Following the success of the first event that took place in St. Petersburg, Russia (http://www.rndm.pl/rndm09/rndm09final.pdf), RNDM 2010 is aimed at attracting world-class participants from both academia and industry working in the area of reliable networks design and modeling.
Special attention will be paid to network survivability, i.e. the capability to deliver essential services in the presence of failures. Therefore, the workshop will focus on methods of survivable networks design and modeling, including the issues of dedicated/shared backup paths, p-cycles, fast service recovery, service resilience differentiation, survivability of multilayer networks and others. 


The topics cover, but are not necessarily limited to the following: 

- coordination of multilayer survivability operations,
- design of dedicated/shared backup paths,
- fast service recovery,
- fault management and control in survivable networks,
- impact on detection accuracy and latency on survivability,
- methods for measurement, evaluation, or validation 
  of survivability,
- modeling malicious behaviour or attacks on networks,
- models and algorithms of survivable networks design and modeling,
- multilayer network survivability,
- optical networks survivability,
- p-cycles and other protection structures,
- restoration strategies under different types of failures,
- role of redundancy in survivable networks,
- self-regenerative networks,
- service resilience differentiation,
- survivability of anycast and multicast networks,
- survivability of P2P and overlay systems,
- survivability under traffic grooming in multilayer networks,
- theory and methods of reliability and availability,
- use of self-healing techniques in surviving attacks,
- wired/wireless network survivability.

 
The authors are encouraged to submit full papers describing original, previously unpublished research results, not currently under review by another conference or journal, addressing state-of-the-art research and development in the area of reliable networks design and modeling.
All submitted papers will be reviewed. All accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore and additionally in printed proceedings with an ISBN number. Paper submission and review will be done via EDAS (http://www.edas.info/newPaper.php?c=8823&track=9505). The maximum length of submitted papers should not exceed 6 pages formatted according to the IEEE instructions available at http://www.ieee.org/web/publications/authors/transjnl/ 

Extended version of papers of special merit will be considered for publication in a Journal Special Issue. A Best Paper Award will be given.

Seventh International Conference on Data Integration in the Life Sciences
in Gothenburg, Sweden
August 25th - 27th 2010

The development and increasingly widespread deployment of high throughput experimental methods in the life sciences is giving rise to numerous large, complex and valuable data resources. This foundation of experimental data underpins the systematic study of organisms and diseases, which increasingly depend on the development of models of biological systems. The development of these models often requires integration of diverse experimental data resources; once constructed, the models themselves become data and present new integration challenges for tasks such as interpretation, validation and comparison.
Topics of Interest

DILS provides a forum for the discussion of emerging challenges for data integration in the life sciences, and the techniques that seek to address them. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

    * Architectures and data management techniques for the life sciences
    * Query processing and optimization for biological data
    * Biological Data sharing and update propagation
    * Query formulation assistance for scientists
    * Modeling of life sciences data
    * Biological Metadata management
    * Annotation in scientific data integration
    * Provenance modeling and management for the life sciences
    * Scientific Workflows and analysis pipelines
    * Laboratory information management systems in biology
    * Biological data quality and data cleaning
    * Life sciences ontologies
    * Semantic web for the life sciences
    * Mining integrated life sciences data
    * Text mining in the life science literature
    * Machine learning in data integration in the life sciences
    * Grid Computing and Grid technologies for the life sciences
    * System prototypes for biology
    * Commercial solutions in the life sciences
    * Integration challenges presented by new kinds of biological data
    * Scientific results arising from innovative data integration solutions

Description

Cloud computing is increasingly being used for what was known as ""on-demand"" and ""utility computing"". The services provided, the APIs and the applications that can be hosted by these Cloud providers have superseded the use of the grid, and are increasingly becoming popular with users. The Cloud is a paradigm shift, where details are abstracted from the users; they no longer need expert knowledge about using the various technologies and running their applications on service infrastructure. Cloud computing provides a consumption and delivery model for IT services based on Internet, and it typically involves the provision of dynamically scalable and virtualized services.

There services that are provided by various Cloud providers, which include commercial entities, such as Amazon and Google, as well as those that are open-source systems, such as provided by Open Cirrus and Eucalyptus.

In this workshop we will examine and explore the services, interfaces and types of applications that can be executed on Cloud systems. In addition, we are interested in the interfaces used to access the underlying services, the processes of using virtualization, the range and scope of applications that can be executed, the security used by these services, and aspects such a service level agreements and quality of service provided. In addition, we are keen to know about the services that are used, and whether these are appropriate for various types of applications, such as sophisticated workflows and HPC.

ACL 2010 workshop on  NLP and Linguistics: Finding the Common Ground
  Uppsala, Sweden

1. Workshop Description
         
This workshop aims at examining the relationship between linguistics and
NLP and studying
(1) the new methods in incorporating linguistic knowledge into statistical
    systems to advance the state of the art of NLP, and
(2) the feasibility of using NLP techniques to acquire linguistic knowledge
    for a large number of languages and to assist linguistic studies.

 Since early 1990s, with the advancement of machine learning methods and the
availability of data resources such as treebanks and parallel corpora,
data-driven approaches to NLP have made  significant progress. The success
of such data-driven approaches has cast doubt on the relevance of
linguistics to NLP.  Conversely, NLP techniques are rarely used to help
linguistics studies. We believe that there is room to expand the
involvement of linguistics in NLP, and likewise, NLP in linguistics, and
believe that the cross-pollination of ideas between the disciplines can
greatly benefit both fields.

 One common approach to take advantage of linguistic knowledge is to train
a statistical system on linguistically annotated data such as treebanks.
Another approach is to represent linguistic knowledge as rules in a
rule-based approach. This workshop is interested in research that goes
BEYOND these common approaches and explores new methods in incorporating
linguistic knowledge into statistical systems or using statistical systems
for linguistic knowledge discovery.

 The workshop will consist of one invited talk, 2-3 panels, group discussion,
and paper/poster sessions.


2. Topics of Interest
 
 The workshop is interested in research that explores new methods in
incorporating linguistic knowledge into statistical systems or using
statistical systems for linguistic knowledge discovery.
These include, but are not limited to, the following themes:

  [T1] Research that shows awareness of particular linguistic phenomena
       and its effects on statistical systems.

       For instance, being aware of syntactic phenomena such as scrambling,
       cross-serial dependencies and long-distance movement is very relevant
       to parsing (e.g., earlier work on using different grammar formalisms
       such as LTAG/CCG/HPSG/LFG to handle these phenomena or more recent
       work on non-projective dependency parsing).

       Similarly, being aware of word formation patterns (e.g., reduplication
       in Chinese) or allomorphic variation patterns (e.g., vowel harmony in
       Turkish) could help word segmentation and morphological analysis.
    

  [T2] New methods in incorporating linguistic knowledge into
       statistical systems to improve the start of the art.
      (e.g., as rules in a preprocessing step, as linguistic features in
       a statistical system, as filters for pruning a search space, as priors
       in an objective function).


  [T3] Research that demonstrates the feasibility of creating NLP systems to
       automatically acquire linguistic knowledge for a large number of
       languages.

       In order to make generalizations about language universals, linguists
        need to gather information about as many individual languages as
        possible.  However, knowledge about most languages is not complete.
        Can we use NLP techniques to acquire knowledge (e.g., basic word
        order, case marking, tense, aspect, word formation rules, etc.) for
        hundreds of languages, which could help in the construction of
        resources such as WALS (http://wals.info) (Haspelmath et al., 2005)?


  [T4] Research that demonstrates the benefits of using NLP techniques to
       help particular linguistic studies. For instance, given some language
       data, can the categorization of languages into families be automated?
       Can historical interactions between languages be identified
       automatically (e.g., areal effects and borrowings, but beyond just
       lexical borrowings)?  Can NLP tools run over corpora
       of different dialects of the same language systematically identify
       differences in the two dialects (e.g., not just word choice
       differences, but also choice and frequency of particular
       constructions)?
      

  The systems described in the paper should be properly evaluated and
   compared with the start of the art.

  On the submission form, please specify the theme that your paper falls into.

=================================================================

Workshop at ACL 2010
Association for Computational Linguistics Conference
Uppsala, Sweden - July 16th, 2010
http://www.textgraphs.org/ws10/

Deadline for paper submission: Monday, April 5th, 2010

TextGraphs is at its fifth edition! This shows that two seemingly distinct
disciplines,
graph theoretic models to computational linguistics, are in fact intimately
connected,
with a large variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications
adopting efficient
and elegant solutions from graph-theoretical framework.

The TextGraphs workshop series addresses a broad spectrum of research areas
and
brings together specialists working on graph-based models and algorithms for
natural
language processing and computational linguistics, as well as on the
theoretical
foundations of related graph-based methods. This workshop series is aimed at
fostering an exchange of ideas by facilitating a discussion about both the
techniques
and the theoretical justification of the empirical results among the NLP
community
members. Spawning a deeper understanding of the basic theoretical principles
involved,
such interaction is vital to the further progress of graph-based NLP
applications.


Special Theme: Graph Methods for Opinion Analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------

For the fifth edition of TextGraphs, we propose the special theme: ""Graph
Methods for
Opinion Analysis"". This choice is motivated by two important factors: (1)
advanced
opinion analysis that aims to go beyond polarity recognition necessitates
the integration
of syntactic, semantic and logic structures and (2) previous work in NLP has
shown that
graph methods are very well suited to represent and exploit such structures
in learning
systems.

The aim is to bring together researchers from graph theory and opinion
analysis in
order to enable cross-fertilization of ideas. The proposed theme will
encourage
publication of early results and initiate discussions of issues in this
area. We hope that
this will help to shape future directions for ambitious opinion analysis
research and
provide a new, challenging problem motivation for research in graph
algorithms.

Finally, as the field of opinion mining advances towards deeper analysis and
more
complex systems, graphical approaches may become even more pertinent. For
instance,
graphs may be employed to capture opinion dynamics over time, or to model
interactions between opinion expressions across multiple modalities and, to
realize this,
new graph-based algorithms and inference methods may need to be developed.


Suggested topics
---------------------

We invite submissions on the following (but not limited to) general topics
(including those
from the special theme):
* Graph methods for sentiment lexicon induction
* Analysis of blog and web linking structures
* Graph methods for sentiment/opinion propagation
* Graph representation of data for opinion analysis
* Synonym/antonym graphs and their usage to extrapolate semantic orientation
* Social graphs and opinion analysis
* Graph-based representations, acquisition and evaluation of lexicon and
ontology
* Dynamic graph representations for NLP
* Properties of lexical, semantic, syntactic and phonological graphs
* Clustering-based algorithms
* Application of spectral graph theory in NLP
* Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning models based-on graphs
* Dynamic graph representations for NLP
* Comparative analysis of graph-based methods and traditional machine
learning
Techniques for NLP applications
* Kernel Methods for Graphs, e.g. random walk, tree and sequence kernels
* Graph methods for NLP tasks, e.g. morpho-syntactic annotation, word sense
disambiguation, syntactic/semantic parsing
* Graph methods for NLP applications, e.g. retrieval, extraction and
summarization of
information
* Semantic inference using graphs, e.g. question answering and text
entailment
recognition

30,"Fifth IEEE Workshop On Networking Technologies For Softward Defined Radio (Sdr) Networks

Looking for paper submissions.

Motivated by the skyrocketing demand for radio spectrum, facilitated by regulatory policy movements, and enabled by advances in RF technologies, there has been significant research towards developing networking technologies for white spaces -- the allocated but unutilized and under-utilized radio spectrum. One noticeable example is the recent prototype development and FCC historical rulings on white spaces in the TV bands. This workshop aims at providing a timely venue for discussing the current activities and findings in the field of cognitive radio networks, dynamic spectrum access, interference prevention, coexistence, and regulatory issues. This workshop will focus on recent advances as well as challenging papers. Areas of interest include but are not limited to:

    * Spectrum Sensing and Spectrum Management
    * Cognitive Radio Test-Beds and Hardware Prototypes
    * DSA/Cognitive Radio Standardization Activities (e.g. IEEE P1900, IEEE 802.22)
    * Accreditation, Trust, & Security Mechanisms for DSA Networks
    * Cross-Layer Protocol Design
    * Cooperation and Game-Theoretical Protocols for Cognitive Radios
    * Practical Experience and System Implementation

Poster/Demo Submission Instructions:
Submission of a demo or a poster requires a written 3-page summary describing the demo or the research results that are to be presented. Submission should go through EDAS.

UT Austin French and Italian Graduate Students Organization Conference
Mapping the Community: Text, Image and Sound
April 9-10, 2010
University of Texas, Austin
 
The UT-Austin French and Italian Graduate Student Association proudly announces the Seventh Annual Graduate Student Conference at the Department of French and Italian, University of Texas at Austin on April 9-10, 2010. 

 This conference aims to evaluate conceptions of community in Italy, France, the Francophone world and the Italian Diaspora from an interdisciplinary perspective. We welcome papers encompassing either linguistics, literature, or both. Participants are asked to address communities, keeping in mind Benedict Anderson's theory of the ""imagined community"" or Edward Said's ""imagined geographies"". That is to say that participants should consider the idea that the community is an imagined space or population to which the individual belongs through their perception as part of the group. We aim to develop concepts of the community that encompass textual, visual, and/or aural media. We also wish to consider the development of language as a function of community identity.  

The literature keynote speaker will be Dr. Alec Hargreaves, Director of the Winthrop-King Institute for Contemporary French and Francophone Studies and Ada Belle Winthrop-King Professor of French at Florida State University. Dr. Hargreaves is the author, translator, and editor of several books and articles, including Multi-ethnic France: Immigration, Politics, Culture, and Society (2007), Memory, Empire, and Postcolonialism: Legacies of French Colonialism (2005), Post-colonial Cultures in France (1997).

===============================================================================

BACKGROUND

The advent of multicore and manycore systems requires that programmers
understand how to design, write and debug parallel programs effectively.
The increased complexity of multi-threaded parallel programming on
multicore platforms requires more insight into program behavior, and
necessitates the use of tools that can support programmers in migrating
existing software to multicore platforms, and in writing new multi-threaded
parallel software. Programmers need increasingly sophisticated methods
for instrumentation, measurement, analysis and modeling of applications.
To help software developers embrace the multicore revolution, we need
both sophisticated tools to support parallel software development, and an
extensible tool infrastructure that promotes integration of existing and new
tools, and simplifies information exchange and access.


TOPICS

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to

 * Static and dynamic analysis tools
 * Instrumentation, measurement, analysis, and modeling of applications
 * Analysis and visualization tools for assisting programmers with parallel
   software design
 * Active testing tools
 * Applications profiling and performance analysis
 * Data visualization and analysis infrastructures for interaction of tools


PAPER SUBMISSION

Submissions should be formatted according to the IEEE standard

Workshop on Multilinguality in Information Access Evaluation: Bringing Content, Users, Languages and Tasks into the Loop
Milton Keynes, England


Services and users of multilingual IR systems continue to evolve, with many new factors and trends influencing the field. E.g., we are moving to a situation in which there is no longer a single dominant language in which most online information is captured and, with the advance of broadband access and the evolution of both wired and wireless connectivity, users are not just information consumers, but also producers. Text now comes in many shapes: user generated, with low publishing threshold, heavily contextualised, often code switching and multi-lingual, and under little or no editorial control, changes the scene for much of the processing frameworks we previously have been able to assume: blogs, discussion forums, comments left behind on news sites, IM, SMS, Twitter: many new formats for textual interaction carry valuable and timely information, which needs specific tools for processing.

Artificial Intelligence and Logistics - Workshop at ECAI 2010  
        Lisbon, Portugal, August 17, 2010

http://www.sfbtr8.spatial-cognition.de/ailog-2010/

IMPORTANT DATES

May 11, 2010 (extended)		Paper submission deadline
June 7, 2010		                        Notification of acceptance

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

MOTIVATION

Logistics is concerned with the organization and control of processes in
space and time in order to transport or manufacture goods and the
coordination of the resulting flows of material and information, as well as
monetary flows. Complexity and dynamics of logistic networks have reached a
level that more and more prevents the processes from being entirely
observable and fully controllable, caused by, e.g., a globalized economy, a
shift from buyer's to seller's markets, and shorter product life cycles.
Thus, recent trends in logistics point towards solutions with distributed
and self-organizing processes.

Such logistic networks are characterized by a wide variety of heterogeneous
properties, constraints, and requirements: temporal (very quickly, just in
time), economic (low cost, given budget), physical (smooth, secure travel),
informational (public, secure data), environmental (low energy,
ecology-preserving). Different qualities or modalities need different
representations; transitions between different subsystems require interfaces
between different representations, transformations of processes, and methods
for their selection; knowledge about situations and goals is crucial for the
selection of the most suitable strategy; etc. This manifold set of demands
and the emerging uncertainty requires the inclusion of methods from
artificial intelligence and cognitive science. AIL-2010 addresses the use of
these AI methods in modern logistics.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOPICS OF INTEREST

This workshop addresses researchers from logistics that utilize and develop
AI approaches as well as researchers from AI that apply their work in
logistics or see possibilities to connect to logistic problems or methods.

We encourage contributions from the following research and application
areas:

Possible Research Areas:	

Coordination in Space and Time
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
Multi Modal Interaction
Cognitive Robotics
Cognitive Modeling
Spatial and Temporal Reasoning
Ontologies
Logic and Constraint Programming
Ambient Intelligence
Planning and Scheduling
Multi Agent Systems
Data Mining
Case-Based Reasoning
Machine Learning
Human-machine Interfaces
...

Possible Application Areas:

Transport logistics
Production planning and control
Assembly and disassembly
Process modeling and monitoring
Process planning
Intelligent manufacturing systems
Production Scheduling
Inventory organization and optimization
Automated inspection and quality control
Supply chain management
Traffic management
...

A special focus will be given to applying AI techniques in order to
integrate and interact with humans within the logistic process, may they be 
users, system designers, analysts, or other stakeholders. Intelligent
logistic systems will instruct users; they communicate and explain their
situation and reasoning upon demand; they notify managers about anomalies or 
in case of an emergency; they engage in clarification dialogs upon
misunderstandings. The better the human interface becomes, the more we
expect logistic scenarios to become re-populated by users such that shared  
human-machine scenarios may benefit from human expertise and intelligence   
while operators are relieved from tedious automated routine. This way we
move from a de-centralized view of cooperating autonomous units to an
""emancipated"" society of logistic units interacting among themselves and
with human agents. We explicitly encourage submissions that tackle this
challenge.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Submitted papers must be in PDF format and follow the ECAI style guidelines.
Technical papers must not exceed a length of 6 pages.

We also welcome the submission of position papers or papers describing work
in progress as short papers. Short papers must not exceed a length of 3

Distributed systems research covers a wide spectrum of applications ranging across embedded real/time systems, commercial transaction systems, transportation systems, and military/space systems.  Such systems are subject to some paradigms including coordination due to the absence of centralization, and too much uncertainly result of hardware of software behaviors, heterogeneity and son forth. Indeed, such systems raise several issues not found in single processor systems. The main difficulty arises when considering dependability, security, adaptability and resources constrained computing. This area requires computing systems to run software in an efficient and trustworthy way. That is, in order to be able to design complex architectures in reasonable time, novel and effective design methodologies are needed to automatically build applications from high-level descriptions to take into account what needs to be deployed on hardware. To remedy this weakness, combining both model and component seems to be a very promising cocktail for building solutions to this problem.

The introduction of the component approach in the development of embedded systems allows facilitating their design by building through an assembly of existing components. Indeed, this approach provides a clear separation between the specification and implementation of components. Note however that in the context of component software, distributed architecture is significantly more demanding than that of traditional monolithic integrated solution. Model-driven engineering provides a very useful contribution for the design of distributed systems since it bridges the gap between design issues and implementation concerns. It helps the designer to concentrate on application structure and required behavior and it permits us to specify in a separate way non-functional requirements such as underlying execution infrastructure/middleware, dependability and security issues that are very important to guide the implementation process.

The supporting research in the distributed systems area includes system architecture, design techniques, testing, validation, proof of correctness, modeling, software reliability, operating systems, parallel processing and real/time processing. The goal of this workshop is to present significant works dealing with the design of distributed architecture and applications for embedded systems using both model-driven approach and component-based development. Architecture design involves defining how the architecture is specified.  Here, we focus on design tools with some view of the possible implementations frameworks providing run-time support to take full benefits of existing infrastructure to build flexible efficient distributed systems.

Workshop for Negation and Speculation in Natural Language Processing

Organised by the University of Antwerp and Saarland University

July 10, 2010, Uppsala, Sweden

http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/NeSpNLP2010

========================================

Papers are invited for the one-day workshop to be held in Uppsala on the 10th of July, 2010.

In recent years, research has yielded substantial progress in NLP tasks like NE recognition, WSD, parsing, semantic role labeling, and anaphora resolution among others. This has been in part supported by the organisation of  shared tasks, which provide annotated data, a definition of the task and an evaluation framework, motivating researchers to develop new techniques to tackle these tasks. Other tasks like paraphrasing, summarization or textual entailment have also progressed, but results are still relatively low because deep understanding of language - mapping meaning to meaning - is necessary. This raises methodological questions. Furthermore, large scale linguistic resources are still lacking.

Negation and speculation are two phenomena involved in deep understanding of text. Both are related to expressing the factuality of statements, that is, expressing to which extent a statement is or is not a fact or a speculation. Negation turns an affirmative statement into negative (it rains/it does not rain). Speculation is used to express to which extent a statement is certain or speculated (it might rain/apparently, it will rain/ it is likely to rain/it is not clear whether it will rain/we suspect that it will rain).

SCOPE AND TOPICS

In this workshop we aim at bringing together researchers working on negation and speculation from any area related to computational language learning and processing. The general goal of the workshop is to stimulate research about these topics. Specific goals are to describe the lexical aspects of negation and speculation, to define how the semantics of these phenomena can be modelled for computational purposes, to explore techniques aimed at learning the factuality of an statement, and to  analyse how the treatment of these phenomena affects the efficiency of NLP applications. Finally, the workshop aims at encouraging discussion about the need of deep linguistic processing as a way to take computational linguistics a step further.

The wokshop will address the following aspects of negation and speculation, although it will be open to other related topics:

- Lexical  aspects of negation and speculation
- Linguistic resources with information about negation and speculation: corpora, dictionaries, lexical databases 
- Descriptive analysis of negation and speculation cues
- Negation and speculation across domains and genres
- Negation and speculation in biomedical texts and biomedical text mining 
- Handling negation and speculation in NLP: dialogue systems, sentiment analysis, text mining, textual entailment, information extraction, machine translation, paraphrasing
- Learning the scope of negation and speculation cues
- Interaction of negation and speculation for evaluating the factuality of an statement
- Corpora annotation: guidelines, bootstrapping techniques, quality assessment
- Modelling factuality for computational purposes
- Algorithms to learn negation and speculation
- Structured prediction of negation and speculation 
- Joint learning of negation and speculation
- Inference of factual knowledge

MOTIVATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the past decades, we have seen a revolution in the way science and engineering has been conducted. Specially, computation became an established third brand of science alongside theory and experiment. Scientists now need to access and exploit computational resources and databases that are geographically distributed through the use of high speed networks. Those resources must be modeled and managed in a similar way we model software development and data through software engineering processes and database techniques. In order to attack the next generation of scientific problems, multidisciplinary and distributed teams of scientists need to collaborate to make progress on these new challenges.

Current advances in Software Engineering and Database research, including ontologies, scientific process/workflow modeling, semantic web services, software component management, grid computing, resource modeling, process and data provenance, data curation, among others can help to address these challenges. Several national and international projects around the world have been initiated to carry out research and innovation activities that will transform the goal of e-Science and Grid computing into a reality.

The IV e-Science workshop aims at bringing together recent developments in databases and software engineering towards a computerized infrastructure to accomplish science in the large, supporting the next generation of scientific research and experiments. The definition, execution and management of scientific experiments can no longer be developed in an ad-hoc manner. The topic of e-science or cyberinfrastructure is part of the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂGrand Challenges in Computer Science Research in Brazil ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 2006 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 2016ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ report from the Brazilian Computer Society.

This workshop serves as a forum to present, discuss and establish new partnership among scientists that participate in research and product/tool developments, and highlights related activities from the Brazilian and international community. The first three versions of the event were co-located with SBBD/SBES, and showed that there is an interesting audience on the theme. New projects are taking place, based on partnerships on the database and software engineering area. In this forth edition, we would like to extend the possible fields of collaborations to other areas of Computer Science that have much to contribute to e-Science.

49,"1st International Workshop on Reuse in Business Process Management

In Conjunction with BPM 2010 (The 8th International Conference on Business Process Management)


=== Aims and Scope ===

The current complexity inherent in the corporative world demands a great dynamism from the IT infrastructure in order to provide technical solutions for conducting business. Business Process Management (BPM), including its service-oriented foundation, has been providing important technological support to improve organization competitiveness. In order to increase dynamism and competitiveness, BPM can benefit from reuse approaches and techniques at several stages of business process life cycle.

The 1st International Workshop on Reuse in Business Process Management will be dedicated to explore any type of reuse in the Business Process Management domain. Therefore, it will be a forum to discuss systematic reuse applied to BPM at its various levels:

   4. the Quality of Service and Semantics orthogonal level.

Moreover, the impact of reuse on business- and service-oriented engineering as well as how it can help in the design of more high-quality process models are very important topics to be discussed in this workshop.

Different existing reuse approaches and techniques can be extended to be applied to this fairly new domain, including: software product line or software product families; variability descriptors; design patterns such as feature modeling; aspect-orientation; and component-based development. In addition, completely new approaches and techniques can be proposed. Their use must also be discussed, preferably under experimentation as well as results analysis.

1. Conference Description

The Eleventh Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI-10) will provide an international forum for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences which concentrate on AI technologies and their applications in areas of social and economic importance for countries in the Pacific Rim.

PRICAI2010 will be held at the Novetel Hotel in Daegu, Daegu is the fourth largest city in South Korea and has been the center of history, administration, education, and culture. The city has many cultural heritages and tourist attractions to well display Korean culture as well as complexes, department stores and large shopping malls.


2. Special session on (Semi-)automatic Creation of Language
     Resources for Asian Languages

 As part of the conference, we are organizing a special session on
  (Semi-)automatic Creation of Language Resources for Asian Languages.
  Language resources (e.g., parallel/comparable corpora,
  treebanks/Propbank/discourse treebanks, WordNet, FrameNet,
  and dictionaries) are invaluable for natural language processing.
  In the past two decades, there have been much effort in creating
  such resources; however, many of the studies rely on manual annotation,
  which is labor extensive and expensive.

 This special session aims to provide an opportunity for researchers
  to share their ideas and efforts in automating the process of creating
  language resources for Asian languages. Topics of interest include but
  are not limited to:
    * Automatic extraction of bilingual/comparable corpora from the Web
    * Automatic compilation of bilingual/multi-lingual dictionaries
    * (Semi-)automatic annotation of treebanks
    * (Semi-)automatic creation of WordNet and FrameNet for a new language
    * Automatic merging of language resources with different annotation
        schemes and/or from different sources


3. Important dates:
 * Submission deadline: March 31, 2010, 23:59 Pacific standard time (PST)
 * Notification: May 15, 2010
 * Camera-ready deadline: May 31, 2010
 * Conference date: Aug 30 - Sept 2, 2010


4. Submission information

 The papers should report original and unpublished research on topics of
interest for the special session. Accepted papers are expected to be presented
at the conference, and will be published in the conference proceedings. They
should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should
indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.

 Papers for special sessions should be prepared in accordance with the
PRICAI 2010 requirements (http://sc.snu.ac.kr/PRICAI10/PRICAI10Prep.html),
and submitted through the PRICAI 2010 submission website

Reliable and Autonomous Computational Science Conference
In Atlanta, Georgia, USA, on the 28th October 2010

Theme & Goal
 Increasing size and complexity of software and hardware systems makes it harder to ensure their reliability. At the same time, the issues of autonomous computing become more critical as we more and more rely on software systems in our daily life. Such complexity is getting even more critical with the ubiquitous computing of embedded devices and other pervasive systems. These trends make it necessary to support software engineers with a set of techniques and tools for developing reliable and autonomous software. To cope with the growing complexity, RACS focuses on is a place for highly original ideas about reliable and autonomous software. The purpose of the RACS 2010 is to bring together researchers from diverse communities who are interested in building reliable and autonomous computing technologies more robust, and to discuss and exchange experimental or theoretical results, novel design, work-in-progress, experience, case study, and trend-setting ideas.


Papers
 Authors are invited to submit original papers in all areas of reliable software and autonomous computing. All papers will be fully refereed and undergo a blind review process by at least three referees. All accepted papers should be submitted in ACM 2-column camera-ready format for publication in the conference proceedings. The final version of the paper should not be more than 6 pages long; 4 extra pages will be allowed at additional cost. Selected papers will be recommended for publication in an International Journal as a special RACS 2010 section.


Wokshop Proposal
 In conjunction with the RACS 2010 conference, a number of workshops will be organized. Workshop proposals which should include ""Title of the workshop"", ""Short bio of organizers"", ""A tentative list of TPC"", and "" A tentative website address"" are to be sent to the workshop Chair(stjhang@suwon.ac.kr) by March 10, 2010.

The Fourth Symposium on Semantic Mining in Biomedicine
will be held at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) in
Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, UK on October 25th and 26th, 2010.

SMBM 2010 aims to bring together researchers from text and data mining
in biomedicine, medical, bio- and chemoinformatics, and researchers
from biomedical ontology design and engineering. SMBM 2010 is the
follow-up event of SMBM 2005 (EBI, U.K.), SMBM 2006 (University of
Jena, Germany) and SMBM 2008 (University of Turku, Finland).

A parallel event (LBM: The International Symposium on Languages in
Biology and Medicine) has been held in 2005 (KAIST, Daejeon, South
Korea), 2007 (Matrix, Biopolis, Singapore) and 2009 (Jeju Island,
South Korea).

The biomedical research community eagerly awaits the full integration
of very large text collections, biological databases, ontologies and
terminological resources. However, many challenges have yet to be met
to achieve this ambitious goal. Significant advances have been made
and many working systems for tasks ranging from entity recognition and
simple relation extraction to structured event extraction have been
deployed. Where do we stand and how do we advance toward fully
integrated systems combining the different tools and data sources?

We are inviting papers from a full range of topics (see below),
emphasizing in particular work on methods deployed in a
production-like research environment, the integration of text with
domain resources such as micro-array data and ontological resources
such as GO, UMLS etc. We also welcome contributions from across the
biomedical domains, including genomics, translational medicine,
clinical practice, and public health.

For detailed up-to-date information, please consult the web site of the
conference: http://www.smbm.eu/

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

    * Text mining, information extraction, and information retrieval
    * Terminology and ontology development for biomedical information
      systems
    * Evaluation techniques and standards for text mining solutions
    * Integration of text and data mining in the biomedical domain
    * Annotation schemes for biomedical corpora
    * Text mining for resource building, e.g. ontologies, and resource
      enrichment, e.g., biomedical databases
    * Representation and discovery of biomedical domain knowledge
    * Privacy/trust, e.g in processing of patient records
    * Image/caption processing in relation to content extraction
    * domain-specific reasoning processes, e.g., to infer
      non-explicit information, validation (trust-worthiness,
      believability, safety) of extracted information
    * (Semantic) Web mining of biomedical information

All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings
that will be available online. We invite both full and short papers,
where full papers will be given an oral presentation and short papers
presented as posters. Selected papers will be invited to submit an
extended version for publication in the Journal of Biomedical
Semantics (JBMS).

Submissions should follow the instructions for JBMS authors, with a
limit of eight (8) pages for full papers and four (4) pages for short
papers (plus one optional page for references). Manuscripts will be
submitted electronically as PDF files. Reviewing will be double-blind,
and submissions should therefore NOT contain author names or other
obviously identifying information.

CALL FOR PAPERS

Evaluation of Information Filtering Systems in a Competitive Intelligence Framework Workshop
Workshop date: 22 May 2010
Held in conjunction with LREC 2010

Valetta, Malta

Aims

The constant growth of publicly available information has entailed a
consequently similar growth in the research areas devoted to the
automated organization of this information. In particular, Information
Filtering systems have been developed to tackle the issues of many
applications of business intelligence, from mail categorization to news
routing and technology watch. However, the theoretically challenging
models of these systems have seldom been evaluated in real usage
context. Indeed, standard evaluation benchmarks usually introduce
artefacts that simplify the task. For instance, in the context of
competitive intelligence, systems must filter documents without any
global information on a ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂcollectionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ but can use feedback from the user,
and must be efficient enough to deal with a real-time document stream.
Furthermore, with the increase of globalized access and availability of
the information, sources may be found in many languages, and the
multilinguality issue must also be considered. TREC Adaptive Filtering
Track and INFILE track at CLEF for multilingual information filtering
have tried to propose evaluation frameworks closer to the usage.

The goal of this workshop is to study different aspects of Information
Filtering Evaluation and to bring together researchers from the
community of Information Filtering to develop new evaluation frameworks
and confront current models with these new evaluation models.
Submissions are expected to propose new insights on evaluation
methodologies and resources for Information Filtering or to present
Information Filtering models that will meet the requirements of a real
usage evaluation (in particular, researchers that submit papers
presenting Information Filtering Models are encouraged to evaluate their
model using an existing benchmark such as the INFILE benchmark,
available at http://www.infile.org).

Topics

Both theoretical and practical research papers are welcome from both
research and industrial communities addressing the main workshop theme,
in any aspect including:
- Resources and methodologies for Evaluation of Information Filtering
Systems in real usage context
- New models for Information Filtering, that tackle one or several
issues of this kind of evaluation: efficiency, adaptability,
multilinguality, etc.
- Results of the Evaluation of Information Filtering Systems
- User studies of the use of Information Filtering Systems in
Competitive Intelligence

MFCS Symposia

The series of MFCS symposia, organized in rotation by Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic since 1972, has a long and well-established tradition. The symposia encourage high-quality research in all branches of theoretical computer science. Their broad scope provides an opportunity to bring together researchers who do not usually meet at specialized conferences. Quality papers presenting original research on theoretical aspects of computer science are solicited.

The 35th International Symposiums on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (MFCS 2010) is organized in parallel with the 19th EACSL Annual Conferences on Computer Science Logic (CSL 2010) at the same place. There will be common plenary sessions and social events, but the technical program and the proceedings are prepared independently.

The federated MFCS & CSL 2010 conference is accompanied by several satellite workshops on more specialized topics.

SCOPE

The Internet has made it easier to perpetrate traditional crimes by providing criminals an alternate avenue for launching attacks with relative anonymity. The increased complexity of the communication and networking infrastructure is making investigation of the crimes difficult. Clues of illegal activities are often buried in large volumes of data that need to be sifted through in order to detect crimes and collect evidence. The field of digital forensics is becoming very important for law enforcement, network security, and information assurance. This is a multidisciplinary area that encompasses multiple fields, including: law, computer science, finance, networking, data mining, and criminal justice. The applications of this technology are far-reaching which include law enforcement, disaster recovery, accounting frauds, homeland security, and information warfare. This conference brings together practitioners and researchers from diverse fields providing opportunities for business and intellectual engagement among attendees. The conference is organized by the College of Information Technology at Zayed University with the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering (ICST).

TUTORIAL (tentative)

Advances in Digital Image Forensics
by Dr. Nasir Memon, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA

Given the ease by which digital images can be created, altered, and manipulated with no obvious traces, digital image forensics has emerged as a research field with important implications for ensuring digital image credibility. This tutorial will provide an overview of recent developments in the field, focusing on three problems. First, collecting image evidence and reconstructing them from fragments with or without missing pieces. This involves sophisticated file carving technology. Second, attributing the image to a source, be it a camera, a scanner, or a graphically generated picture. The process entails associating the image with a class of sources with common characteristics (device model) or matching the image to an individual source device, for example a specific camera. Third, attesting to the integrity of image data. This involves image forgery detection to determine whether an image has undergone modification or processing after being initially captured.

5th International Workshop on Distributed Cooperative Laboratories: Instrumenting the Grid

May 12-14, 2010
Poznan, Poland

A number of problems in science, industry and commerce, which require broad international cooperation, may be addressed by using sophisticated equipment and top-level expertise. Therefore, the development and dissemination of techniques and technologies that allow virtualized, remote and shared access to industrial or scientific instruments are essential for the progress of society. The possibility of using scientific or industrial equipment independently of their physical location helps towards equality of opportunity for and unification of communities, and subsequently provides new momentum for industry, science, and business.
The current edition of the Workshop goes beyond exploitation of remote instrumentation on the Grid. First of all, it focuses on new Remote Instrumentation (RI) aspects related to middleware architecture, high-speed networking, wireless Grid for acquisition devices and sensor networks, QoS provisioning for real-time control, measurement instrumentation and methodology. Additionally, it will provide knowledge about automation of mechanisms oriented to accompanying processes that are usually performed by a human. Another important point of this workshop is focusing on the future trends concerning RI systems development and actions related to standardization of remote instrumentation mechanisms.
The Workshop will be structured in technical sessions, some of which will be organized by leading researchers in the field, and will accommodate both invited and regular papers, selected on an open-call basis. INGRID 2010 allows also additional possibilities to be actively engaged in the conference program:
1) Special sessions - proposals for special sessions are welcome. Please provide the session description (1-1.5 page) including a draft session program. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the International Program Committee.
2) Extended abstracts - in alternative to full paper submission authors can provide an extended abstract (1-2 pages). The abstracts positively approved give a chance to make a presentation at the conference. A subsequent full paper will be reviewed independently, with a chance to add the paper to the post-workshop proceedings.

Modeling and Simulation (M&S) is increasingly becoming a central 
activity in the design of new systems and in the analysis of 
existing systems because it enables designers and researchers to 
investigate systems behavior through virtual representations. For 
this reason, M&S is gaining a primary role in many industrial and 
research fields, such as space, critical infrastructures, 
manufacturing, emergency management, biomedical systems and 
sustainable future. However, as the complexity of the 
investigated systems increases and the types of investigations 
widens, the cost of M&S activities increases because of the more 
complex models and of the communications among a wider number and 
variety of M&S stakeholders (e.g., sub-domain experts, simulator 
users, simulator engineers, and final system users). To address 
the increasing costs of M&S activities, collaborative 
technologies must be introduced to support these activities by 
fostering the sharing and reuse of models, by facilitating the 
communications among M&S stakeholders, and more generally by 
integrating processes, tools and platforms. 

Aside from seeking applications of collaborative technologies to 
M&S activities, the workshop seeks innovative contributions that 
deal with the application of M&S practices to the design of 
collaborative environments. These environments are continuously 
becoming more complex and therefore their design requires 
systematic approaches to meet the required quality of 
collaboration. This is important for two reasons: to reduce 
rework activities on the actual collaborative environment, and to 
maximize the productivity and the quality of the process the 
collaborative environment supports. M&S offers the methodologies 
and tools for such investigations and therefore it can be used to 
improve the quality of collaborative environments. 

A non-exhaustive list of hi-level topics includes: 

* collaborative environments for M&S 
* agent-based M&S 
* collaborative distributed simulation 
* net-centric M&S 
* web-based M&S 
* model sharing and reuse 
* model building and evaluation 
* modeling and simulation of business processes 
* modeling for collaboration 
* simulation-based performance evaluation of collaborative 
  networks 
* model-driven simulation engineering 
* domain specific languages for the simulation of collaborative 
  environments 
* domain specific languages for collaborative M&S 

To stimulate creativity, however, the workshop maintains a wider 
scope and invites interested researchers to present contributions 
that offer original perspectives on collaboration and M&S.

Knowledge Engineering in Global Software Development Workshop (KNOWING)


Knowledge engineering is an evolutionary process of engineering artefacts and using them to gain new understandings. These new understandings are then used to further engineer or modify artefacts and the process continues.
Knowledge engineering in global software development is being increasingly researched by the software and the knowledge management communities.
To implement a good knowledge management strategy in a global software engineering environment,organizations have to overcome issues which have been identified in many previous studies. These issues make global software distribution a difficult and complex task.
Hosting a workshop on this topic at the International Conference on Global Software Engineering will bring together researchers from both these communities in a forum where they can discuss and explore similarities between both communities' research.
Topics should have a global software development focus and include, but are not limited to:


*	knowledge management within software engineering from a business perspective 
*	collaboration and knowledge sharing 
*	knowledge discovery services and tools 
*	workflows and decision making including experiences with Wiki support 
*	methods and tools for managing knowledge 
*	architectural knowledge management practices 
*	skills management and transfer of knowledge

business functionality. These services can then be mixed and matched to
create entirely new applications or to deliver new business capabilities.
As a concept, SOA is not new. It is a product of the evolution of IT
architecture and distributed computing concepts. However, it has only become
a reality over the last few years because of the emergence of standards and
maturation of supporting technology. The Internet has played a significant
role in the evolution of these standards, allowing (Web) services to
interoperate globally within and across the boundaries of large and small
organizations. Without standards, it would be difficult for services to
communicate and interact with each other. Consequently, the aforementioned
sharing, reuse and combination of services to create business processes on
an as-needed basis would not be possible.
At its core, service orientation is about aligning technology to efficiently
and flexibly support the process and performance needs of the business.
It means a technology capability that:

Under conventional approaches to building IT systems, an application typically
supports a pre-defined set of business requirements (such as sales orders or
accounting). Whenever a new business need arises, organizations build or install
new applications. This is highly inefficient especially when the different
applications perform similar tasks and share the same data. Hence, SOA provides
both IT flexibility and business agility.
SOA is an industrial reality with projects and commercial offers. Moreover, related
advanced topics are numerous as : Cloud Computing, Grid, Green IT, Software as a
Service, Aspect Based Services, service based Multi Agent Systems ...
This first workshop on Recent  Trends  in SOA Based Information  Systems  provides
a forum for researchers and practitioners to present results, applications, and
experiences in software based on SOA and Web services. The organizing committee
welcomes high quality contributions that describe original and unpublished works
in the field of services-based application engineering in terms of design, development,
testing, and deployment, Enterprise Service Bus ...

SCOPE

With the rapid growth of the Internet as well as the increasing demand for broadband services, access networks have been receiving growing investments in recent years. This has led to a massive network deployment with the goal of eliminating the bandwidth bottleneck between end-users and the network core. Today many diverse technologies are being used to provide broadband access to end users. The architecture and performance of the access segment (local loop, wired and wireless access networks, and even home networks) are getting increasing attention for ensuring quality of service of diverse broadband applications. Moreover, most access lines will no longer terminate on a single device, thus leading to the necessity of having a home network designed for applications that transcend simple Internet access sharing among multiple personal computers and enable multimedia support. Therefore, the access network and its home portion have become a hot investment pool from both a financial as well as a research perspective.

The aim of the annual International Conference on Access Networks (ACCESSNETS) is to provide a forum that brings together scientists and researchers from academia, as well as managers and engineers from the industry and government organizations to meet and exchange ideas and recent work on all aspects of access networks and how they integrate with their in-home counterparts. ACCESSNETS 2010 is the fifth edition of this exciting event, which will be held in Budapest, Hungary, on 3-5 November 2010. The conference will consist of technical sessions, industry track, workshops and panels. The technical sessions will present original and fundamental research advances while the industry track, workshops and panels will focus on development, application and related business issues in this hot and exciting area.

SCOPE

Our society has entered an era where commercial activities, business transactions and government services have been, and more and more of them will be, conducted and offered over open networks such as the Internet. It has led to new opportunities for criminals and new challenges for law enforcement. For instance, Voice over IP raises significant challenges for call intercept and route tracing; information systems are becoming overwhelmingly large and the challenge of information source identification requires new sophisticated tools; consumer multimedia devices are increasingly becoming the tools to create potentially illegal content. At the same time, the scientific gathering and investigation of evidence at a crime scene push towards a variety of fascinating digital techniques.

Electronic telecommunications, information technology, consumer devices and sophisticated software are creating new opportunities for both criminals and forensic investigators. This conference aims to bring together the research contributions in the development of tools and techniques that assist in the investigation of potentially illegal activity associated with electronic communication and electronic devices. It will also investigative the practice and requirements for presentation of evidence in court. This might include the discovery, analysis, handling and storage of digital evidence, meeting the legal burden of proof, and the establishment of the forensic chain of evidence.


***

TOPICS

Technical papers describing original, previously unpublished research, not currently under review by another conference or journal, are solicited. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

    * Digital evidence gathering, storage and handling protocols
    * Records tracing and data mining
    * Fraud management in commercial transactions
    * Device forensics
    * Techniques for addressing identity theft
    * Data carving
    * Content filtering
    * Geo-location techniques for cellular, ad-hoc, wireless and IP network communications
    * Distributed data association across massive, disparate database systems
    * Multimedia source identification
    * Image tamper identification
    * Image association and recognition
    * Motion analysis
    * Voice analysis

Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon Workshop
2nd SIGLEX endorsed COLING Workshop (August 22, 2010, Beijing)  


Submission deadline: May 30, 2010

================================================================================

AIMS and TARGET AUDIENCE

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers involved in the construction and application of electronic dictionaries to discuss modifications of existing resources in line with the users' needs, thereby fully exploiting the advantages of the digital form. Given the breadth of the questions, we welcome reports on work from many perspectives, including but not limited to: computational lexicography, psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, language learning and ergonomics.


MOTIVATION

Whenever we read a book, write a letter or launch a query on a search engine, we always use words, the shorthand labels and concrete forms of abstract notions (concepts, ideas and more or less well specified thoughts). Yet, words are not only vehicles to express thoughts, they are also means to conceive them. They are mediators between language and thought, allowing us to move quickly from one idea to another, refining, expanding or illustrating our possibly underspecified thoughts. Only words have these unique capabilities, which is why they are so important.

Obviously, a good dictionary should contain many entries and a lot of information associated with each one of them. Yet, the quality of a dictionary depends not only on coverage, but also on accessibility of information. Access strategies vary with the task (text understanding vs. text production) and the knowledge available at the moment of consultation (word, concept, speech sounds). Unlike readers who look for meanings, writers start from them, searching for the corresponding words. While paper dictionaries are static, permitting only limited strategies for accessing information, their electronic counterparts promise dynamic, proactive search via multiple criteria (meaning, sound, related words) and via diverse access routes. Navigation takes place in a huge conceptual lexical space, and the results are displayable in a multitude of forms (e.g. as trees, as lists, as graphs, or sorted alphabetically, by topic, by frequency).

Many lexicographers work nowadays with huge digital corpora, using language technology to build and to maintain the lexicon. But access to the potential wealth of information in dictionaries remains limited for the common user. Yet, the new possibilities of electronic media in terms of comfort, speed and flexibility (multiple inputs, polyform outputs) are enormous. Computational resources are not prone to the same limitations as paperbound dictionaries. The latter were limited in scope, being confined to a specific task (translation, synonyms, ...) due to economical reasons, but this limitation is not justified anymore.

Today we can perform all tasks via one single resource, which may comprise a dictionary, a thesaurus and even more. The goal of this workshop is to perform the groundwork for the next generation of electronic dictionaries, that is, to study the possibility of integrating the different resources, as well as to explore the feasibility of taking the user's needs, knowledge and access strategies into account.


TOPICS

For this workshop we invite papers including but not limited to the following topics:

    Conceptual input of a dictionary user. What is in the authors' minds when they are generating a message and looking for a word? Do they start from partial definitions, i.e. underspecified input (bag of words), conceptual primitives, semantically related words, something akin to synsets, or something completely different? What does it take to bridge the gap between this input, incomplete as it may be, and the desired output (target word)?

    Organizing the lexicon and indexing words. Concepts, words and multi-word expressions can be organized and indexed in many ways, depending on the task and language type. For example, in Indo-European languages words are traditionally organized in alphabetical order, whereas in Chinese they are organized by semantic radicals and stroke counts. The way words and multi-word expressions are stored and organized affects indexing and access. Since knowledge states (i.e. knowledge available when initiating search) vary greatly and in unpredictable ways, indexing must allow for multiple ways of navigation and access. Hence the question: what organizational principles allow the greatest flexibility for access?

    NLP applications: Contributors can also demonstrate how such enhanced dictionaries, once embedded in existing NLP applications, can boost performance and help solve lexical and textual-entailment problems, such as those evaluated in SEMEVAL 2007, or, more generally, generation problems encountered in the context of summarization, question-answering, interactive paraphrasing or translation.

AIMS AND SCOPE
-----------------------------

As model-driven engineering (MDE) spreads, disciplines like model transformation, domain specific languages (DSLs) and traceability become essential in order to support different kinds of models in an model-driven environment. Understanding the role of ontology technologies like knowledge representation, automated reasoning, dynamic classification and consistency checking in these fields is crucial to leverage the development of such disciplines. Thus, we highlight the following open questions: How can the scientific and technical results around ontologies, ontology languages and their corresponding reasoning technologies be used fruitfully in MDE? What is the role of ontologies in supporting model transformation or traceability? How can ontologies improve designing DSLs? Are current query languages able to query both kinds of models? 

Discussions about these and related questions will be supported by this workshop. TWOMDE2010 aims at providing a forum for discussing the application of different aspects of ontologies to enhance model-driven engineering.

The intended audience embraces members of the modeling community with experience or interest in model-driven engineering and in Knowledge Representation. Specifically, but not only, the participation of experts in technologies related with UML, MOF, ATL, QVT, RDF or OWL is highly welcome.


TOPICS OF INTEREST
-----------------------------

TWOMDE2010 is the exclusive forum at a MDE conference to address the application of ontologies in model-driven development. The potential of this field has just started being explored.

For this edition, we expect use cases in a wider range of topics. Topics of interest are but not exclusive:

  * RDF metamodel repository: interfaces and models to store, retrieve, query and manage MOF/Ecore metadata in RDF stores.

  * Reasoning over MOF-based models using ontologies: verification and validation of models using ontologies; application of Description Logics reasoning in UML diagrams or MOF/Ecore models, in order to enhance and to support models and metamodels at design time as well as at runtime.

  * Application of ontologies in model transformation: usage of ontologies and reasoning to automatically generate model transformations; validation of model transformations; use of reasoning in model transformation rules.

  * Reasoning and query languages for integrated models: development or integration of query languages able to retrieve objects of MOF-based models and OWL-based models; reasoning approaches or algorithms regarding both semantics of Description Logics semantics of and MOF-based models.

  * Integration of modeling standards and metamodeling of ontology technologies: integration approaches like aspect-oriented programming to weave modeling standards like MOF, Ecore, UML, OCL, ODM, and SWRL; development, improvement or integration of metamodels for ontology technologies, for example, OWL, SWRL, F-Logic.

  * Ontology driven software development: ontology support to web service orchestration; software architectures and methodologies for developing semantic web services and agents; reuse of web service ontologies or application of reasoning in specifying execution logics of orchestration.

  * MDE tools using ontologies: implementations of MDE tools relying on ontologies or on reasoning services.

  * Semantic support to Domain Specific Languages: integration of metamodeling and ontologies in order to provide abstract syntax and formal semantics for DSL.

  * Ontology engineering with MDA/MDE techniques: application of MDA/MDE techniques in order to support ontology engineering activities like ontology pruning, ontology refactoring, or ontology measurement.

  * Ontology connectors to system models: methods and techniques for integrating ontology constructs like classes and properties with MOF-based constructs like classes, properties or operations.

  * Application of Ontologies in traceability and provenance: usage of model annotations, ontologies and reasoning in order to improve traceability between MOF-based models.

Miami, Florida, USA, held between July 5-10, 2010 in conjunction with ICWS 2010, SCC 2010, and CLOUD 2010
 
Aims and Scope

Mobile systems are characterized with autonomous, dynamically adaptable, and heterogeneous components collaborating in open intra-organizational environments to provide solutions. Next generation phones, mobile networks, mobile cloud computing are a few examples of mobile applications where code, users and their devices continuously move. Evolving requirements, such as reliability, security, scalability, performance and privacy, from fixed to mobile settings, has revealed new and important challenges. This is due to the behavioural constraints that mobility poses, and that were not faced in traditional distributed settings. Examples include: dynamic network topology, changes in location, constrained resource availability, communication protocols heterogeneity, unstable connectivity, and so forth. The service-oriented paradigm is a promising approach for engineering open, dynamic and distributed systems. There are a plethora of research issues on how mobile systems can make use of service oriented engineering techniques.

The EMSOS Workshop aims to bring together researchers from academia and industry, as well as practitioners in the area of engineering services in mobile environments in order to provide a forum where recent research results can be presented and discussed. The aim is to understand open issues in the software engineering area of services applied in mobile environments, and to build a community of researchers and practitioners willing to collaborate on these issues.

The workshop seeks contributions that address theoretical foundations, important issues, recent developments, applications, methods, practical techniques, tools, empirical studies, experience, and lessons learned related to engineering mobile service oriented systems. 

List of Topics

The list of topics include, but are not limited to:

    * Mobile services in the cloud
    * Business Process Modelling and Requirements of services for mobility;
    * Model-Driven Service Engineering for mobile systems;
    * Software Product Line and mobility

SCOPE

PLAS aims to provide a forum for exploring and evaluating ideas on the
use of programming language and program analysis techniques to improve
the security of software systems. Strongly encouraged are proposals of
new, speculative ideas, evaluations of new or known techniques in
practical settings, and discussions of emerging threats and important
problems.

The scope of PLAS includes but is not limited to:

* Compiler-based security mechanisms or runtime-based security
  mechanisms such as inline reference monitors
* Program analysis techniques for discovering security vulnerabilities
* Automated introduction and/or verification of security enforcement
  mechanisms
* Language-based verification of security properties in software
  including verification of cryptographic protocols
* Specifying and enforcing security policies for information flow and
  access control
* Model-driven approaches to security
* Security concerns for web programming languages
* Language design for security in new domains such as cloud computing
  and embedded platforms
* Applications, case studies, and implementations of these techniques

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We invite papers in two categories:

* Full papers should be at most 12 pages long including bibliography
  and appendices. Papers in this category are expected to have
  relatively mature content. Full paper presentations will be 25
  minutes each.

* Position papers should be at most 6 pages long including
  bibliography and appendices. Preliminary and exploratory work are
  welcome in this category. Position paper presentations will be 10
  minutes each. Authors submitting papers in this category must
  prepend the phrase ""Position Paper: "" (without quotes) to the title
  of the submitted paper.

Submissions should be PDF documents typeset in the ACM proceedings
format using 10pt fonts. SIGPLAN-approved templates can be found at
http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm. We recommend
using this format, which improves greatly on the ACM LaTeX format. All
submissions must be in English. Page limits are strict.

Both full and position papers must describe work not published in
other refereed venues (see the SIGPLAN republication policy at
http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/republicationpolicy.htm for
details). Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings
which will be distributed to workshop participants and be available in
the ACM Digital Library.

Scope:
===================

The advances in wireless technologies and mobile devices have enabled 
the realization of a wide range of wireless networking opportunities. 
The coexistence of wireless heterogeneous networks has been widely 
recognized, and it has become more and more common that new mobile 
devices get equipped with multiple and heterogeneous wireless interfaces. 
Furthermore, the recent advances in software-defined and cognitive radio 
technologies promise even more diversity and heterogeneity. This brings 
about a lot of opportunities and challenges for mobile wireless networking.  
   
With the emerging wireless technologies, mobility has more generic 
meaning than just node movement as in the traditional sense. It also 
means that when the operational environment changes (such as frequency 
and power), a node or the network adapts to the environmental changes, 
which requires the cognitive capability. On one hand, it is of critical 
importance that seamless, low latency and transparent services are 
provided to the users, via potentially multiple heterogeneous wireless 
technologies or opportunistic spectrum access involved during the 
course of node movement or environmental changes. Environment cognizance, 
spectrum-aware mobility management, and vertical handoff become critical 
components in the solution space. On the other hand, host and network 
mobility also affects the performance of network protocols significantly, 
while at the same time allows opportunistic interconnections of heterogeneous 
networks, which in turn makes mobility adaptability an important design issue. 
This asks the design of wireless architectures, protocols, spectrum management, 
and mobility management mechanisms to be revisited. 

Cohesive with the main theme of Globecom 2010 --- ""moving into the age 
of mobile interactivity"", the workshop welcomes original submissions from 
both researchers and practitioners that explore recent advances in 
architecture, system, protocol, modeling, and testbed design, as well as 
emerging applications and standards to enable seamless mobility and 
transparency in wireless networks. Topics of interest include, but are 
not limited to:

- Architecture, system, and protocol design for seamless roaming support 
  in wireless networks

- Spectrum cognition and agility associated with mobility 

- Vertical handoff and seamless integration of heterogeneous networks

- Location tracking, positioning, and address management

- Mobility modeling and theoretical/experimental validation

- Mobility impact on routing, resource/power/QoS management

- Adaptive and resilient protocols for seamless mobility support at all layers, 
  as well as cross-layer approaches

- Security and privacy issues under mobility and network access

- Emerging standards and applications on mobility

- Simulation/testbed tools and experimental measurements

2nd Workshop on
Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources

Beijing

INTRODUCTION

The workshop builds upon the success of the first ACL ""The People's Web
meets NLP"" Workshop in 2009 that attracted 21 submissions. Accepted
submissions included papers on Wikipedia [1], Wiktionary [2], Mechanical
Turk [3], and game-based construction of semantic resources [4]. This
clearly demonstrates a substantial and growing interest of the NLP
community in collaboratively constructed semantic resources (CSRs),
also evidenced by the increasing number of publications in this area
and the EMNLP 2009 Web 2.0 track. In many works, CSRs have been used
to overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck and coverage problems
pertinent to conventional lexical semantic resources. The greatest
popularity in this respect can so far certainly be attributed to
Wikipedia [1]. However, other resources, such as folksonomies or the
multilingual collaboratively constructed dictionary Wiktionary, have
also shown great potential. Thus, the scope of the workshop deliberately
includes any collaboratively constructed resource, not only Wikipedia.

Effective deployment of CSRs to enhance NLP introduces a pressing need
to address a set of fundamental challenges, e.g. the interoperability
with existing resources, or the quality of the extracted lexical
semantic knowledge. Interoperability between resources is crucial as
no single resource provides perfect coverage. The quality of CSRs is
a fundamental issue, as they lack editorial control and entries are
often incomplete. Thus, techniques for link prediction [5] or
information extraction [6] have been proposed to guide the ""crowds""
while constructing resources of better quality.

TOPICS

The workshop will bring together researchers from different worlds, for
example those using collaboratively constructed resources as sources of
lexical semantic information for NLP purposes such as information
retrieval, named entity recognition, or keyword extraction, and those
using NLP techniques to improve the resources or extract and analyze
different types of lexical semantic information from them. We will
especially welcome contributions of interdisciplinary nature, e.g. those
applying discourse analysis techniques from computational linguistics to
the content of CSRs to better understand their properties.

Specific topics include but are not limited to:
 * Analysis of collaboratively constructed resources, such as wiki-based
   platforms, folksonomies, Twitter, or social networks;
 * Using collaboratively constructed resources for NLP purposes such
   as information retrieval, text categorization, information
   extraction, etc.;
 * Using special features of collaboratively constructed resources to
   create novel resource types, for example revision-based corpora,
   simplified versions of resources, etc.;
 * Analyzing the structure of collaboratively constructed resources
   related to their use in NLP;
 * Interoperability of collaboratively constructed resources with
   conventional lexical semantic resources and between themselves;
 * Mining social and collaborative content for constructing structured
   semantic resources and the corresponding tools;
 * Mining multilingual information from collaboratively constructed
   resources;
 * Quality and reliability of collaboratively constructed semantic
   resources. 

We especially encourage short papers describing publicly available tools
for accessing or analyzing collaboratively constructed resources that can
serve as a multiplier in the NLP community.

The workshop is intended to be highly interdisciplinary. Thus, we encourage
the participation of researchers working on computational linguistics
aspects (e.g. parsing or discourse analysis) or NLP applications (e.g.
information retrieval, information extraction, question answering, and
knowledge representation) as well as researchers from other areas who
might benefit from collaboratively constructed semantic resources.

Substantially extended versions of the best papers from the workshop can
be submitted to a planned Special Issue in one of the major computational
linguistics journals. The revised papers will have to undergo a separate
reviewing process required for journal publications.

Call for MT Research Papers at AMTA-2010

Contact: Hassan Sawaf (hassan (at) sawaf.de)

Machine Translation continues to be one of the most active research areas
within Natural Language Processing.  MT evaluations, such as those
conducted by NIST, provide ample evidence that the field of MT continues
to grow and attract more and more researchers.  Data-driven approaches
have become particularly fashionable in recent years.  These approaches
have generated systems that have been the top performers in recent
comparative evaluations.  Furthermore, the challenges of building
competitive MT systems have been significantly reduced with the
introduction of open source toolkits such as GIZA++ and MOSES.  This
development, exciting as it is, also bears the danger of introducing
uniformity into MT research.  AMTA aims to promote diversity in MT
research and actively seeks research papers across the entire range of the MT research spectrum for the AMTA-2010 research program.  We solicit
submissions in English of unpublished papers describing original research
on all aspects of Machine Translation.  We particularly encourage
submissions on topics related to the conference theme of MT applied within commercial translation settings.

MT User Presentations:  Government Users and Translation Professionals

Contacts: Nick Bemish  ( Nicholas.Bemish@dia.mil )
       Chuck Simmons ( Charles.Simmons@wpafb.af.mil )


AMTA Government User presenters and participants will focus on the
strategic nature and use of Machine Translation in governmental
organizations.  Most governmental entities are providing a benefit to
their customers, who require them to translate large volumes of
information and to make it available across multiple languages and varied
network architectures.  The need for language translation technology
within governmental organizations is diverse and sometimes compartmented.
Governments are looking to advances in Machine Translation technology,
which help them deliver information not only from the native languages of various countries but also into those other languages.  In
turn, the information delivered helps the governments to understand social
and political activities in context.  In an age when significant volumes
of data are available in many languages, it is necessary to look to
automated alternatives, which assist the linguist and enable the human
translation process.

For this year's AMTA conference, we are asking government participants to
consider topics that address the strategic challenges of applying MT tools
and applications in their programs and processes.  We are looking for
representation from all government organizations that face language
challenges, including: Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human
Services, Human Resources, Commerce, Labor, Energy, Judiciary, Business,
Trade, Transportation, and many others.  Within the governmental
organizations we request the attendance of leaders or their
representatives, who can address challenging topics ranging among:

1.  Acquisition strategies that include policies directed towards      implementation of MT
2.  Funding priorities that stress the need for metrics to ensure adequate     return on investment (ROI)
3.  Requirements development which include a broad audience of users
   across the federal workspace
4.  Computer systems and network architectures that support inclusion of
   MT tools and any significant integration and security challenges
5.  Research and development leading to the advancement of tools that
   support less commonly used languages or minimizes gaps
6.  Program management strategies and how they apply to the integration
   and acceptance of MT tool usage
7.  Case studies on examples of MT use and how it impacts the
   organizations ability to share content
8.  Strategic views and objectives pertaining to challenges with respect
   to MT programs and the employment of MT tools (e.g., IT, personnel,
   implementation)
9.  Implementation strategies that factor into MT use as a process
   supporting human translation (pre-translation/post-editing)

The sessions will be structured to provide open and constructive dialogue
among attendees with diverse technical backgrounds and areas of expertise. A secondary objective of this approach is to establish longer-term
connections among participants and foster new cooperative efforts.


Important dates:

- Submissions due:                     Monday, June 28
- Notification of acceptance:          Monday, July 12
- Final ""camera-ready"" versions due:   Monday, August 16


What to submit:

Ideal proposals should include information on strategic views and
objectives pertaining to MT programs; employment of MT tools and
significant challenges; as well as information on achievable gains through usage and/or metrics.  Submissions should be 250-400 word summaries and
may be sent directly in e-mail or as attachments in RTF format.


How to submit:

Send submissions and questions to Government User program chairs, Nicholas Bemish at Nicholas.Bemish@dia.mil and Chuck Simmons at
Charles.Simmons@wpafb.af.mil  by Monday, June 28.

Call for Proposals for Workshops, Tutorials and Panels at AMTA-2010

Contact: George Foster ( george.foster@nrc.gc.ca )

AMTA 2010 is seeking proposals for workshops, tutorials and plenary panels
on all topics related to MT.  We particularly encourage proposals on
topics related to the conference theme of MT applied within commercial
translation settings.

Tutorials will be held on Sunday, October 31, immediately preceding the
main conference.  Workshops will be held on Thursday and Friday, November
4-5, immediately following the main conference.  Selected panels will be
an integral part of the main conference.


Aims:

Tutorials at AMTA conferences are a forum for experts in MT and MT-related areas to deliver concentrated training on a topic of interest in half-day
(or occasionally full-day) teaching sessions.  Tutorials provide
background that helps conference participants (especially newcomers to the field) understand the conference program, and/or enrich their
understanding of particular technical, applied, and business matters
surrounding research, development and use of MT and translation
technology.

AMTA workshops are intended to provide the opportunity for MT-related
communities of interest to spend focused time together advancing the state
of thinking or the state of practice in their area of interest or
endeavor.

Panel sessions within the main conference program provide an opportunity
for a select number of experts to provide their perspective and hold a
discussion on a concrete topic of interest or developing issue within the
field of MT.

Due to AMTA 2010's collocation with the ATA meeting, we are particularly
interested in proposals related to commercialization of MT and/or its use
by professional translators.  However, any themes connected to MT
research, development, deployment, use, and evaluation are welcome.


What to submit:

Proposals for workshops, tutorials and panel sessions should be submitted
by June 30, 2010 to George Foster (george.foster@nrc.gc.ca).  They should
include the proposed format (workshop, tutorial or panel), a title, a
one-page description of the proposed content, technical requirements and
the expected number of participants.  In the case of a workshop, the
proposal should also include dates for important milestones (call for
papers, recruitment of speakers, etc.), and whether this is an ongoing or
new workshop.  Workshop and Tutorial proposals must also include a signed
copy of the AMTA Workshop or Tutorial Policy and Leader Agreement Form. The appropriate forms will be posted on the conference web-page at:

Call for MT Research Papers at AMTA-2010

Contact: Hassan Sawaf (hassan (at) sawaf.de)

Machine Translation continues to be one of the most active research areas
within Natural Language Processing.  MT evaluations, such as those conducted
by NIST, provide ample evidence that the field of MT continues to grow and
attract more and more researchers.  Data-driven approaches have become
particularly fashionable in recent years.  These approaches have generated
systems that have been the top performers in recent comparative evaluations.
Furthermore, the challenges of building competitive MT systems have been
significantly reduced with the introduction of open source toolkits such as
GIZA++ and MOSES.  This development, exciting as it is, also bears the danger
of introducing uniformity into MT research.  AMTA aims to promote diversity in
MT research and actively seeks research papers across the entire range of the
MT research spectrum for the AMTA-2010 research program.  We solicit
submissions in English of unpublished papers describing original research on
all aspects of Machine Translation.  We particularly encourage submissions on
topics related to the conference theme of MT applied within commercial
translation settings.

- Notifications of acceptance:   Monday, July 5
- Final ""camera-ready"" versions: Monday, August 16


Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- Advances in data-driven MT (Statistical MT, Example-based MT, etc.)
- Advances in rule-based MT (Transfer-based MT, Interlingual MT, etc.)
- Lexicon and grammar acquisition and induction
- Hybrid approaches that integrate and unify aspects of rule-based MT and 
  statistical MT
- MT for resource-poor languages
- MT on resource-limited machinery (e.g. PDAs)

MT User Presentations:  Government Users and Translation Professionals

Contacts: Nick Bemish  ( Nicholas.Bemish@dia.mil )
          Chuck Simmons ( Charles.Simmons@wpafb.af.mil )


AMTA Government User presenters and participants will focus on the strategic
nature and use of Machine Translation in governmental organizations.  Most
governmental entities are providing a benefit to their customers, who require
them to translate large volumes of information and to make it available across
multiple languages and varied network architectures.  The need for language
translation technology within governmental organizations is diverse and
sometimes compartmented.  Governments are looking to advances in Machine
Translation technology, which help them deliver information not only from the
native languages of various countries but also into those other languages.  In
turn, the information delivered helps the governments to understand social and
political activities in context.  In an age when significant volumes of data
are available in many languages, it is necessary to look to automated
alternatives, which assist the linguist and enable the human translation
process.

For this year's AMTA conference, we are asking government participants to
consider topics that address the strategic challenges of applying MT tools and
applications in their programs and processes.  We are looking for
representation from all government organizations that face language
challenges, including: Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services,
Human Resources, Commerce, Labor, Energy, Judiciary, Business, Trade,
Transportation, and many others.  Within the governmental organizations we
request the attendance of leaders or their representatives, who can address
challenging topics ranging among:

1.  Acquisition strategies that include policies directed towards 
    implementation of MT 
2.  Funding priorities that stress the need for metrics to ensure adequate
    return on investment (ROI) 
3.  Requirements development which include a broad audience of users across
    the federal workspace 
4.  Computer systems and network architectures that support inclusion of MT
    tools and any significant integration and security challenges 
5.  Research and development leading to the advancement of tools that support
    less commonly used languages or minimizes gaps 
6.  Program management strategies and how they apply to the integration and
    acceptance of MT tool usage 
7.  Case studies on examples of MT use and how it impacts the organizations
    ability to share content 
8.  Strategic views and objectives pertaining to challenges with respect to MT
    programs and the employment of MT tools (e.g., IT, personnel,
    implementation) 
9.  Implementation strategies that factor into MT use as a process supporting
    human translation (pre-translation/post-editing)

The sessions will be structured to provide open and constructive dialogue
among attendees with diverse technical backgrounds and areas of expertise.
A secondary objective of this approach is to establish longer-term
connections among participants and foster new cooperative efforts.


Important dates:

- Submissions due:                     Monday, June 28
- Notification of acceptance:          Monday, July 12
- Final ""camera-ready"" versions due:   Monday, August 16


What to submit:

Ideal proposals should include information on strategic views and objectives
pertaining to MT programs; employment of MT tools and significant challenges;
as well as information on achievable gains through usage and/or metrics.
Submissions should be 250-400 word summaries and may be sent directly in
e-mail or as attachments in RTF format.


How to submit:

Send submissions and questions to Government User program chairs, Nicholas
Bemish at Nicholas.Bemish@dia.mil and Chuck Simmons at
Charles.Simmons@wpafb.af.mil  by Monday, June 28.

Call for Proposals for Workshops, Tutorials and Panels at AMTA-2010

Contact: George Foster ( george.foster@nrc.gc.ca )

AMTA 2010 is seeking proposals for workshops, tutorials and plenary panels on
all topics related to MT.  We particularly encourage proposals on topics
related to the conference theme of MT applied within commercial translation
settings.

Tutorials will be held on Sunday, October 31, immediately preceding the main 
conference.  Workshops will be held on Thursday and Friday, November 4-5,
immediately following the main conference.  Selected panels will be an
integral part of the main conference.


Aims:

Tutorials at AMTA conferences are a forum for experts in MT and MT-related
areas to deliver concentrated training on a topic of interest in half-day (or
occasionally full-day) teaching sessions.  Tutorials provide background that
helps conference participants (especially newcomers to the field) understand
the conference program, and/or enrich their understanding of particular
technical, applied, and business matters surrounding research, development and
use of MT and translation technology.

AMTA workshops are intended to provide the opportunity for MT-related
communities of interest to spend focused time together advancing the state of
thinking or the state of practice in their area of interest or endeavor. 

Panel sessions within the main conference program provide an opportunity for a
select number of experts to provide their perspective and hold a discussion on
a concrete topic of interest or developing issue within the field of MT.

Due to AMTA 2010's collocation with the ATA meeting, we are particularly
interested in proposals related to commercialization of MT and/or its use by
professional translators.  However, any themes connected to MT research,
development, deployment, use, and evaluation are welcome.


What to submit:

Proposals for workshops, tutorials and panel sessions should be submitted by
June 30, 2010 to George Foster (george.foster@nrc.gc.ca).  They should include
the proposed format (workshop, tutorial or panel), a title, a one-page
description of the proposed content, technical requirements and the expected
number of participants.  In the case of a workshop, the proposal should also
include dates for important milestones (call for papers, recruitment of
speakers, etc.), and whether this is an ongoing or new workshop.  Workshop and
Tutorial proposals must also include a signed copy of the AMTA Workshop or
Tutorial Policy and Leader Agreement Form.  The appropriate forms will be
posted on the conference web-page at:

INTRODUCTION
Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) has emerged as a new computing paradigm for designing, building and using software applications to support business processes in heterogeneous, distributed and continuously changing environments. The architectural foundation for SOC is provided by the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), which states that applications expose their functionality as services in a uniform and technology-independent way such that they can be discovered and invoked over the network. Claimed benefits of SOC include cheaper and faster development of business applications through repeated aggregation of services, better reuse of software artifacts and legacy applications through service wrappings, and easier adaptation to changes in the business environment through replacement and reconfiguration of services.

In order to realize these benefits routinely with SOC, for realistic business settings with complex IT environments, many challenges still need to be addressed. For example, supporting business processes and collaborations in an open service-oriented world requires a better understanding of integration problems along different dimensions. First of all, alignment between business demands and application functions has to be achieved. This requirement for vertical integration should drive the aggregation of services, from basic IT services to rich business services, to achieve the desired or given business processes. Secondly, horizontal integration has to be considered if business collaborations span multiple organizations. In such cases, interoperability between the services has to be ensured at different levels (syntactic, semantic and pragmatic) and on different aspects (information and behavior). Thirdly, we have to assume that business demands as well as IT capabilities will change over time. This evolution will impact existing solutions, and thus require the adaptation, management and maintenance (e.g., versioning, replacing, updating) of services and service compositions. Moreover, changes that occur at one level or on one aspect have to be propagated to other levels and aspects in order to keep the consistency of the integration solution. And finally, all of the above challenges not only exist at design-time, but at run-time as well. Service composition may be on-demand, driven by an end-user service creation activity, and running instances of composite services are subject to changes concerning, for instance, the availability of resources. This implies that service level agreements and associated quality-of-service need to be negotiated, monitored, and controlled in multi-party and heterogeneous environments.

GOAL AND TOPICS
The goal of the workshop is to focus on the fundamental and practical challenges related to SOC, to discuss what theoretical, architectural or technology foundation is needed, and how this foundation can be supported or realized by new or enhanced infrastructures, standards and/or technologies. The workshop aims at contributing to the dissemination of research results, establishment of a better understanding, and identification of new challenges related to SOC/SOA, by bringing together interested academic and industrial researchers. 

Topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

Service foundation and design issues
	- principles of SOC/SOA, service science
	- service modelling approaches
	- formal specification and analysis

LREC 2010 Workshop on Web Logs and Question Answering

Valletta, Malta, Saturday 22nd May 2010

www.csis.ul.ie/wlqa2010

Submission deadline: 12th February 2010

Motivation & Scope
==================

An Information Retrieval system takes a user query and returns a ranked list
of documents. On the other hand, a Question Answering system provides an
exact answer [1]. There has been quite a long period of research in factoid
QA driven by annual tracks at CLEF [2], TREC [3] and NTCIR [4]. The result
of this work has been that it is possible to construct systems which can
answer simple factoid queries with high accuracy. This has led to the belief
that QA is a ""solved problem"" where no more research is required. However,
the questions are not usually from real users, they are devised by the
assessors at CLEF, TREC etc. Secondly, they are restricted to certain
well-known simple types which are only a small subset of the real questions
which people wish to ask. Thirdly, questions are considered in isolation (or
in some tracks a fixed group) and not in a dialogue context whereas in our
interactions with people all questions are answered in context and with the
possibility for clarification. Thus, there is a need to inject new ideas
into QA research.

Recently there has been much interest in Web query logs and in particular
methods for analysing these in order to extract information which can be
used to improve IR systems [5,6]. Logs are typically extremely large and
contain naturally occurring and noisy data. Automatic techniques (using for
example statistical approaches or machine learning algorithms) are therefore
necessary since manual approaches are not generally feasible.

The purpose of the workshop, therefore, is to investigate how some of the
methods developed for analysing web logs within an implicit IR context can
be applied to QA. For example:

* Can the meaning of IR queries in logs be deduced automatically in order to
extract the corresponding questions from them?

* Can NLP techniques developed within QA, e.g. Named Entity recognition be
applied to the analysis of query logs?

* Can logs be used to deduce useful new forms of question (i.e. not simple
factoids) which could be looked at next by QA researchers?

* Can questions grouped into sessions be comprehended in such a way as to
deduce the underlying implicit natural language dialogue consisting of a
coherent sequence of questions where each follows logically from both the
previous ones and the system's responses to them?

* Are there logs from real (or experimental) QA systems like lexxe.com which
can be obtained and what can be learned from them from the perspective of
designing evaluation tasks? What about logs from sites like answers.com
(where queries are answered by human respondents)?

* Are QA query logs different from IR query logs? Do users behave
differently in QA systems? Can QA-style questions be identified within an IR
log?

* Can click-through data - where the aim of a question can be inferred from
the returned documents which are inspected - be used for the development of
QA systems for example for the deduction of important query types and their
links to IR queries?

* Are there logs of transcribed speech made from telephone QA systems which
can be obtained and what analysis could be carried out on those, using for
example techniques developed at related tracks at CLEF such as
Cross-Language Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) and Question Answering on Script
Transcription (QAST)?

Historically, QA was a combination of NLP and IR. Much web log analysis is a
form of IR in which the same problem of retrieval is being approached from a
different direction, namely the queries themselves. Thus we are proposing
here a new combination, namely QA and log analysis. These fields are
complementary and share the goal of building better systems for users.

88,"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications

Taranto, Italy, 6-8 September 2010

Sponsored by the IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society
and the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society

Organized by the IEEE CIS ISATC Task Force on Intelligent Measurement Systems,
the IEEE IMS TC-22 on Intelligent Measurement Systems, and the IEEE IMS TC-30 on Security and Contraband Detection

The wide and increasing needs of adaptable and flexible solutions for many industrial, environmental, and engineering applications point out the importance of using design methodologies and implementation technologies with high ability of adaptation and evolution.  Soft computing is one of the most relevant answers to such needs: neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic/evolutionary algorithms are fundamental keys to tackle these difficult problems.  On the other hand, accuracy and uncertainty issues as well as suited data acquisition systems must be carefully considered in these applications since the quality of the solution greatly relies on them.  Up to now, analysis and experiments have been performed by scientists and practitioners mainly to understand the underlying technologies and methodologies, but without any specific focus on the mandatory need of a quantitative assessment and a metrological analysis.  Measurement science and technologies are in fact vital to ensure the correct and effective use of soft computing technologies in real environments.  CIMSA 2010 will continue the exciting experience of the previous editions by filling this gap in knowledge and practice, by focusing on the quantitative aspect of measurement issues for industrial, environmental, and engineering applications.

Papers are solicited on all aspects of computational intelligence technologies for measurement systems and the related applications, from the points of view of both theory and practice.  This includes but is not limited to: intelligent measurement systems; accuracy and precision of neural and fuzzy components; intelligent sensor fusion; intelligent monitoring and control systems; neural and fuzzy technologies for identification, prediction, and control of complex dynamic systems; evolutionary monitoring and control; neural and fuzzy signal/image processing for industrial and environmental applications; image understanding and recognition; soft-computing technologies for robotics and vision; soft computing technologies for medical and bioengineering applications; hybrid systems; fuzzy and neural components for embedded systems; hardware implementation of neural and fuzzy systems for measurements; neural, fuzzy and genetic/evolutionary algorithms for system optimization and calibration; neural and fuzzy diagnosis of components and systems; reliability of fuzzy and neural components; fault tolerance and testing in fuzzy and neural components; neural and fuzzy techniques for quality measurement.

Workshop Goals

The Computational Linguistics - Applications Workshop was created in 2008 in response to the fast-paced progress in the area.

Traditionally, computational linguistics was limited to the scientists specialized in the processing of a natural language by computers. Scientific approaches and practical techniques come from linguistics, computer science, psychology, and mathematics. Nowadays, there is a number of practical applications available. These applications are sometimes developed by smart yet NLP-untrained developers who solve the problems using sophisticated heuristics.

Computational Linguistics needs to be applied to make the full use of the Internet. There is a definite need for software that can handle unstructured text to allow search for information on the web. According to the European Commission, Human Language Technologies are one of the key research areas for the upcoming years. The priority aim of the research in this area is to enable users to communicate with the computer in their native language.

CLA'10 Workshop is a place where the parties meet to exchange views and ideas with a benefit to all involved. The Workshop will focus on practical outcome of modeling human language use and the applications needed to improve human-machine interaction.
Paper Topics

This call is for papers that present research and developments on all aspects of Natural Language Processing used in real-life applications, such as (this list is not exhaustive):

    * information retrieval
    * extraction of linguistic knowledge from text corpora
    * semantic ontologies in computer linguistics
    * lexical resources
    * machine translation and translation aids
    * ambiguity resolution
    * text classification
    * corpus-based language modeling
    * POS-tagging
    * parsing issues

    * sentiment analysis
    * speech and audio processing
    * text summarization
    * use of NLP techniques in practical applications

 
Paper Presentation

The presentation of the paper has to include a demonstration of an existing tool. The papers should include a section describing the tool (or a prototype), which demonstrates the theory discussed in the paper.

The presentation is divided into two parts. First, the author(s) shortly demonstrate their tools to the audience. In the second part, the authors discuss their work with other participants and let the audience test their software.

Papers will be evaluated and accepted on the basis of their technical merit, usefulness of the real life application and relevance to the workshop scope by the CLA'10 Program Committee. The paper will be assessed by academics as well as industry representatives in order to assure fair and balanced assessment.

All accepted and presented papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings and included in the IEEE Xplore database. The best demonstrations will be selected to be shown to the general audience of the conference at a plenary session.
Papers Submission

 

    * Authors should submit draft papers (as Postscript, PDF of MSWord file).
    * The total length of a paper should not exceed 8 pages (IEEE style). IEEE style templates will be available ASAP.
    * Papers will be refereed and accepted on the basis of their scientific merit and relevance to the workshop.
    * Accepted and Presented paper will be published in the Conference Proceedings and included in the IEEE Xplore Database.

CLA '09 post conference report

It seems that the motto of our workshop ""Show the system in action"" has been accepted by the NLP community. This year 33 papers were submitted (90% increase from last year); 19 of them were accepted by the programming committee. 15 papers were presented during the workshop - our guests from Iran or Tunisia seemingly found Poland too far away from their homelands. Still, 11 countries were represented in the workshop, mainly from the Western Europe.

The workshop was composed of oral presentations and the demo-poster session. Presentations, given on Tuesday (October, 12th), were divided into three sessions:

   1. Information Retrieval,
   2. Use of NLP Tools In practical application,
   3. Parsing issues; Linguistic resources.


In the evening the audience voted for the best presentations of each of the session as well as the best overall performance. The voters used their mobile phones and the result were known immediately - to the chairman. The winners were presented officially at the Gala Ceremony (In the Oscar Ceremony fashion). The Information Retrieval session was one by Igor Leturia from Spain - or rather his virtual agent who could fluently answer any question posed in the Basque language. The session on Practical Applications was won by Eric Wehrli from Switzerland and his micro-scanner that read German texts and translated them into English. Parsing issues were best presented by charming Katarzyna Moroz from Poznan (Poland) who convinced the audience that her new parsing algorithm using pregroup grammars will soon outperform existing ones. And finally, after the three nominees had been presented, the Oscar went to...Spain.

The demo-poster session took place on Wednesday morning. It looked as if the participants had not celebrated too long into the Tuesday night - at 9 a.m. almost all of them were ready to put their applications under the pressure of real tests. Well, the winner did not understand the chairman's Basque too well... she obviously preferred her master, Igor.

FOCUS
-----
The workshop aims at clarifying the role of workflow technology in accelerating science, by providing effective means to automate data management tasks on a large scale. Thus, it sits at the intersection between process management for scientific applications, and data management. 
A number of innovative, but uncoordinated, efforts in data-centric workflows have made their mark on the scientific and business world in recent years. The goal of this workshop is to use these efforts to start bringing together a research community around the theoretical foundations,  technology development,  and domain applications of workflow systems in the context of large-scale data management for science.

In this spirit, we seek contributions from both researchers and practitioners on all aspects of data and process management that contribute towards this goal. More specifically, relevant topics include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Role of workfows in data analytics, mining and statistics 
- Performance estimation and optimization of workflow execution
- Scalability of workflow-based solutions on very large data sets
- Role of metadata in static profiling of dataflows
- Impact of, and new requirements for, workflow technology on open science
- Workflow warehousing, indexing, searching, and mining 
- Workflows for service orchestration
- Mapping workflows to cloud computing environments
- In-database workflow execution
- User interaction models for complex eScience: visibility vs. commoditization
- Workflow repurposing and reuse
- Privacy models for data-centric workflows
- Workflow semantics
- Workflows as invisible middleware
- Workflows in Service-oriented life sciences
- Component-based business intelligence
- Sensor data processing
- Data integration and provenance tracking in medical research

Motivation
++++++++++

During the last years, researchers and practitioners of the Semantic Web
have progressively consolidated a number of very important achievements.
Formal languages have been standardized to define ontology-based knowledge
representations, logic formalisms and query models. Ontology engineering
methodologies and tools have been proposed to ease the designing and
populating of ontological knowledge bases. Reasoning engines have been
implemented to exploit inference capabilities of ontologies, and
semantic-based frameworks have been built to enrich the functionalities of
Web services. These achievements are the pillars to deal with the complex
challenge of bringing semantics to the Web.

The above gives a new ground to extend the focus of the Semantic Web by
engaging it in other communities, where semantics can play an important
role. The available semantic knowledge bases can be used to enrich and link
additional repositories, ontology engineering techniques can be utilized to
properly design and build ontologies in further real-world domains, and
inference and query mechanisms can enhance classic information management
and retrieval approaches.

Among these communities, this workshop aims to attract the attention of
students and professionals both from academia and industry who take benefit
of semantic-based techniques and technologies in within-application
Adaptation, Personalization and Recommendation approaches. In parallel to
the progress made in the Semantic Web research topics, there have been
appearing works in the above areas that use ontologies to model the userÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s
preferences, tastes and interests, and exploit these personal features
together with meta-information about multimedia contents in order to provide
the user with adaptation and personalization capabilities for different
purposes such as information retrieval and item recommendation.

Moreover, with the advent of the Web 2.0 (also called the Social Web), the
potential study and development of those approaches have increased
exponentially. Social networks allow people to provide explicit
relationships with others, and find out implicit user similarities based on
their profiles. Social tagging services offer the opportunity to easily
create and exploit personal knowledge representations. Wiki-style sites
represent an environment where the community contributes and shares
information, and blogs are media in which users express subjective opinions.
In all of these scenarios, adaptation, personalization and recommendation
are core functionalities. However, the understanding and exploitation of the
semantics underlying user and item profiles are still open issues.

++++++++++++++++++
Topics of interest
++++++++++++++++++

The workshop will focus on establishing user/usage models for adaptation,
personalization and recommendation approaches for the Social-semantic Web.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the exploitation of the
Web of Data, the identification of semantics underlying social annotations
of multimedia contents, and the application of semantic-based techniques and
technologies in research fields related to:

   * Personalized access to multimedia content
   * Content-based recommendation and collaborative filtering
   * Adaptive exploration of multimedia content
   * Adaptive user interfaces for multimedia content browsing and searching
   * Community extraction and exploitation
   * Social networks analysis for collaborative recommendation
   * User profile construction based on social tagging information
   * Context-aware multimedia content access and delivery
   * Mobile and ubiquitous multimedia content access and delivery
