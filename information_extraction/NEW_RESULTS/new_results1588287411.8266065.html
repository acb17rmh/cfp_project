Newly deployed services, in particular IPTV, P2P content\ndistribution, and collaborative applications, are stimulating current research\non multicast, broadcast, concast, and anycast. Emerging design issues for a\nfuture multi-service Internet combined with the dynamic development of wireless\naccess techonologies challenge the community to rethink the position of group\ncommunications along the stack.\n\nThe PerGroup workshop invites the community to share efforts in search of\nseamless, pervasive group services, and to discuss directions on a\nhuman-centric multi-service Inter-networking architecture. We welcome\ncontributions that design new solutions or analyze existing deployments, but\nalso those that present striking problem statements or early conceptual work.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nSystem Design &amp; Methodology:\n  - Architectures and protocols for fixed, wireless and ad hoc networks\n  - Protocols and interfaces for intuitive group communications\n  - Intra- and Inter-domain group communication\n  - Native, overlay (including P2P) and hybrid multicast\n  - Topology analysis &amp; measuring, mining and modeling of \n  - media-rich social networks\n  - Measurement, simulation and analytical studies as well as deployment\n    experiences\n\nSupporting Technologies:\n  - Multipath routing / extension of emerging routing schemes\n  - Cooperative relaying and network coding\n  - Service placement and service location\n  - Security and privacy issues for multicast, anycast, and broadcast\n  - Real-time and QoS aspects\n\nApplications:\n  - Adaptive content distribution, e.g., video broadcasting\n  - Application-layer traffic optimization and provider interaction\n  - Multicast &amp; anycast in a future multi-service Internet\n  - New data distribution models to facilitate group communication\n  - Frameworks for human centric based group communications\n\n---------------\nIMPORTANT DATES\n---------------\nFull paper: June 25, 2010\nSubmission deadline: July 11, 2010\nNotification: August 12, 2010\nFinal version: August 31, 2010\n\n----------------------\nORGANIZATION COMMITTEE\n----------------------\nWorkshop Co-Chairs:\n\n- Thomas C.

It will cover a broad range of issues in the fields of\r\nmultilingual and multimodal information access evaluation. It will consist\r\nof two main parts: a peer-reviewed conference (20-21 September) on\r\nexperimental evaluation, which will innovate the CLEF tradition, and a\r\nseries of labs (22-23 September), which will continue the CLEF tradition of\r\ncommunity-based evaluation and discussion on evaluation issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nAim and Scope\r\n\r\nThe CLEF2010 conference aims at advancing the evaluation of complex\r\nmultimodal and multilingual information systems in order to support\r\nindividuals, organizations, and communities who design, develop, employ, and\r\nimprove such systems.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the Internet has been exponential with respect to the number\r\nof users, media, and languages used regularly for global information\r\ndissemination. Language and media barriers are no longer seen as inviolable\r\nand they are constantly crossed and mixed to provide content that can be\r\naccessed on a global scale within a multicultural and multilingual setting.\r\n\r\nUsers need to be able to co-operate and communicate across language and\r\nmedia boundaries, going beyond separate search in diverse media/languages\r\nand exploiting interactions between different languages and media.\r\n\r\nExperimental evaluation - both laboratory and interactive - is a key to\r\nfostering the development of multilingual and multimodal information systems\r\nthat address increasingly complex information needs.\r\n\r\nThe CLEF2010 labs will continue the CLEF tradition of community-based\r\nbenchmarking and will complement these with workshops on emerging issues in\r\nevaluation methodology. Lab proposals were sollicited at an earlier stage\r\nand and the 2010 lab program can be found at  http://www.clef2010.org/. \r\n\r\nAt this time we invite submissions for presentation at the CLEF2010\r\nconference. We welcome submissions on all aspects of multilingual and\r\nmultimodal information access evaluation. All submissions will be reviewed\r\non the basis of relevance, originality, importance, and clarity.\r\n\r\nThe conference proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes\r\nin Computer Science (LNCS) series.\r\n\r\n\r\nTopics for Discussion\r\n\r\nRelevant topics for CLEF 2010 include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Novel methodologies for the design of evaluation tasks, especially\r\nuser-centric ones;\r\n- Analysis of the impact of multilingual/multicultural/multimodal\r\ndifferences in interface and search design;\r\n- Assessing multilinguality and multimodality in relevant application\r\ncommunities, e.g. digital libraries, intellectual property, medical, music,\r\nvideo, and social media.\r\n- Alternative methods for improving and automating ground-truth creation,\r\nfor example crowd-sourcing or clicklog-based;\r\n- Prediction of success and satisfaction rates;\r\n- Task-oriented metrics of success and failure;\r\n- Evaluation of technology vs testing of scientific theories;\r\n- Innovative and easy to communicate techniques for analysing the\r\nexperimental results, including statistical analyses, data mining, and\r\ninformation visualization;\r\n- Alternatives for and comparison of item-based, list-based, set-based, and\r\nsession-based evaluation;\r\n- Simulation (of queries, sessions, users) and information retrieval;\r\n- Infrastructures for bringing automation and collaboration in the\r\nevaluation process;\r\n- Component-based evaluation approaches;\r\n- Evaluation and analysis using private or anonymized test data;\r\n- Living laboraties and evaluating live systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Dates  \r\n\r\n- Submission Deadline: 2 May 2010\r\n- Notification of Acceptance: 11 June 2010\r\n- Camera Ready: 25 June 2010\r\n- Conference: 20-21 September 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat\r\n \r\nAuthors are invited to submit electronically original papers, which have not\r\nbeen published and are not under consideration elsewhere, using the LNCS\r\nproceedings format\r\n(http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0).\r\n\r\nTwo types of papers are solicited:\r\n- long papers: 12 pages max;\r\n- short papers: 6 pages max.\r\n\r\nPapers will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee.\r\nSelection will be based on originality, clarity, and technical quality. \r\n\r\nPapers should be submitted in PDF format to the following address:\r\nhttp://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=clef2010\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganization\r\n\r\nHonorary Chair\r\n- Carol Peters, ISTI-CNR Pisa, Italy\r\n\r\nGeneral Chairs\r\n- Maristella Agosti, University of Padua, Italy\r\n- Maarten de Rijke, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands\r\n\r\nProgramme Chairs\r\n- Nicola Ferro, University of Padua, Italy\r\n- Alan Smeaton, Dublin City University, Ireland\r\n\r\nOrganization Chair\r\n- Emanuele Pianta, CELCT Trento, Italy\r\n\r\n\r\nProgram Committee\r\n\r\n- Eneko Agirre, University of the Basque Country, Spain\r\n- Giambattista Amati, Fondazione Ugo Bordoni, Italy\r\n- Julie Berndsen, University COllege Dublin, Ireland\r\n- Pia Borlund, Royal School of Library and Information Science, Denmark\r\n- Pavel Braslavski, Yandex and Ural State Tech.

      <td>Apologies for multiple postings.\n\n============================================================\nSecond INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP on \nCollaborative Agents -- REsearch and Development (CARE) 2010\n31st August 2010, York University, Toronto, Canada\n\nAbstract submission: April 14, 2010\nFull paper submission: April 16, 2010\n\nhttp://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~xtg/CARE2010/\n============================================================\n\nThe workshop is held in conjunction with the International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT).\nhttp://www.yorku.ca/wiiat10/\n\nSummary\n=======\n\nCollaboration is required when multiple agents achieve complex goals that are difficult or impossible to attain for an individual agent. This collaboration takes place under conditions of incomplete information, uncertainty, and bounded rationality, much of which has been previously studied in economics and artificial intelligence. However, many real world domains are characterised by even greater complexity, including the possibility of unreliable and non-complying collaborators, complex market and incentive frameworks, and complex transaction costs and organisational structures. This workshop's thematic focus is on collaborative and autonomous agents that plan, negotiate, coordinate, and act under this complexity.\n \nThis workshop aims to foster discussions on computational models of collaboration in distributed systems, addressing a range of theoretical and practical issues. We seek contributions of members in research and industry that use the agent paradigm to approach their problems.\n \nSome issues of interest of this workshop are:\no How to enable agents to form and follow joint agreements and contracts in complex organisational and market driven domains.\no How to develop a comprehensive contractual formation/maintenance framework applicable to many application domains.\no How to build comprehensive customer lifecycle management systems for customers, including telecommunication consumers, students and patients.\no How to deploy lifecycle management systems in real world applications, such as healthcare, telecommunication, and smart campuses.\no How to design markets that are adequate for agents to act with incomplete and uncertain information of the behaviour of collaborating agents. \no How to build MAS that work efficiently in partially regulated markets (where governance policy or partnership agreements govern part of the market).\no What are the implications of partial regulation on the management of contractual relationships and service delivery.\no How organisational structures influence the negotiation of agents and the distribution/execution of tasks.\no How to cope with collaborators that exhibit unreliable and non-conformant behaviour, eg where agreements are made but are not always conformed with.\no How can interventions and incentive structures assist in managing contractual relationships and service delivery.\no How to assign transaction costs to actions in planning, assignment, and execution in organisational structures. \no How can transaction costs influence the social outcome of the system which is further influenced by the organisational context under which the collaboration takes place. \no Can lessons learnt in game theoretic computation inform collaborative agent settings.\no What role does learning and adaptivity play in building organisational MAS.\n\nThe one day workshop will feature a mixture of invited talks, discussions and submitted contributions describing current work or work in progress in collaborative agent research and technology. The workshop environment fosters open discussions among all participants, particularly encouraging students to discuss their research topics and seek feedback from senior agent researchers.\n\n\nContact\n=======\n\nCARE organisers\n\nchristian.guttmann@gmail.com\ndignum@cs.uu.nl \n\n\nImportant Dates\n===============\n\nAbstract submission: April 14, 2010\nFull paper submission: April 16, 2010\n Notification: May 28, 2010\nCamera ready: June 7, 2010\n\n\nTopics of Interest include (but are not limited to):\n====================================================\n\nRESEARCH\n* Collaboration frameworks\n* Models of teamwork and joint action\n* Organisation/Institutes/Norms\n* Auctioning/Negotiation\n* Task/Resource allocation\n* Behaviour modelling/monitoring\n* Adherence/Intervention mechanisms\n* Incentive frameworks\n* Intervention mechanisms\n* Agreement technology\n* Contract networks/formation\n* Cloud computing\n\nAPPLICATION AREAS\n* Collaborative care planning/management \n* Disaster planning/management\n* Traffic planning/management\n* Transport/Logistics\n* Applications in primary and preventative healthcare \n* Chronic disease planning/management\n* Epidemiological agent models\n* Unmanned air/land vehicles\n* Robotic soccer/Robotic rescues\n* Weather forecast\n* Artificial and natural immune systems\n* Social networks (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook,...)\n* Smart grid network (e.g., electricity/gas metering)\n\nSubmission and Publication\n==========================\n\nSubmission is to be done electronically at Cyberchair at: http://wi-consortium.org/cyberchair/wiiat10/scripts/ws_submit.php. \nCARE 2010 seeks 4-page submissions formatted according to IEEE specification. \n\nStyle Files for Paper Submission\nIEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscript Formatting Guidelines:\nDOC: ftp://pubftp.computer.org/press/outgoing/proceedings/instruct8.5x11.doc \nPDF:ftp://pubftp.computer.org/press/outgoing/proceedings/instruct8.5x11.pdf \nPS: ftp://pubftp.computer.org/press/outgoing/proceedings/instruct.ps \nLaTex Formatting Macros:\nftp://pubftp.computer.org/Press/Outgoing/proceedings/IEEE_CS_Latex8.5x11x2.zip\n\nSubmissions will be peer-reviewed by two or three reviewers per paper.

These evolutions have come about as a\nresult of relentless research and development efforts across all layers\nof the network hierarchy. As these advances continue to transform our\neveryday lives, many new challenges and opportunities are emerging in\nthe broader area of "next-generation networking". In particular, some of\nthe key focus areas include network heterogeneity, scalability,\nvirtualization, services and applications, security, manageability,\ndependability, and performance predictability. Moreover, the\nnext-generation wireless networks are introducing even more niche\nproblems in mobility management, content distribution, and\nself-organization. \n\nAlong these lines, the planned Next-Generation\nNetworking (NGN) Symposium at IEEE GLOBECOM 2010 will hope to address\nmany of these exciting new focus areas. This symposium will solicit\nparticipation from both academic and industry researchers working in the\narea of next-generation networking technologies, services,\narchitectures, and protocols. The overall goal here will be to present a\nlatest snapshot of the ongoing work as well as to shed further light on\nfuture directions in this space. The symposium will encourage the\nsubmission of novel technical studies as well as broader position and\nvision papers comprising hypothetical/speculative scenarios. \n\nTopics of Interest\n\nThe planned symposium topics of interest include, but are not limited\n\no Future Internet and next-generation networking architectures\no Heterogeneous multi-layer and multi-domain networks, wireless-wireline \n  internetworking\no Overlay networks and peer-to-peer networking\no Network virtualization, virtual private networks (VPN), and services\no Provisioning, monitoring, and management of IP services: traffic\n  engineering, mobility support, etc.\no Flow management: resource sharing, congestion control, etc.\no Routing: unicast, multicast, anycast, etc (wireless, wireline)\no Multihoming, network planning and optimization\no Addressing and naming, especially in the presence of mobility and portability\no Operational and research issues with IPv6\no VoIP protocols and services\no Self-protecting networking\no Switch and router architectures, performance, control, buffer\n  management, packet scheduling \no Network management methodologies and control plane design\no Internet survivability and network resilience strategies\no Mechanisms for self-organisation and autonomous networking\no Traffic measurement, analysis, modeling, visualization, and engineering\no Anomaly, intrusion, and attack detection/prevention\no Policy based mechanisms and high-speed firewall technology\no Packet classification and forwarding mechanisms at ultra-high link rates (ter\nabits)\no High speed and parallel processing architectures for next generation routers\no Connecting mobile/wireless devices to the Internet\no Converged networks and applications, including NGN telecom networks\no Content-based networking: caching, distribution, load balancing, resiliency\no Mobile/wireless content distribution\no Internet applications including interactive media, voice and video,\n  games, immersive applications \no Internet signalling and service enabling protocols, including SIP,\n  NSIS, HTTP, RTSP/RTP, etc \no Privacy and/or security issues and intrusion detection/prevention in\n  the Internet \no Design methodologies for Internet services\no Internet economics, pricing models, accounting, Internet growth\n  modeling \no IP multimedia subsystem: architecture and design\no Next-Generation access networking\n\nImportant Dates\n\n o Paper Submission: March 15, 2010\n o Paper Acceptance: July 1, 2010\n o Camera-ready Paper: August 1, 2010\n o Conference: December 6-12, 2010\n\nSymposium Chairs\n\nYan Chen, Northwestern University\nZhenhai Duan, Florida State University\nNasir Ghani, University of New Mexico\nWojciech Kabacinski, Poznan University of Technology</td>

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 12th\ninternational conference on Advances in Mobile Multimedia (iiWAS2010)\nand the 8thInternational Conference on Advances in Mobile Computing &amp;\nMultimedia (MoMM2010). TwUC covers aspects of trust in ubiquitous\ncomputing environments. The aspects of context, privacy, reliability,\nusability and user experience related to ubiquitous computing\nenvironments represent the main topics of the workshop.\n\nMarc Weiser presented his vision of disappearing and ubiquitous\ncomputing more than 15 years ago. The big picture of the computer\nintroduced into our environment was a big innovation and the starting\npoint for various areas of research. In order to totally adopt the idea\nof ubiquitous computing several houses were build, equipped with\ntechnology and used as laboratory in order to find and test appliances\nthat are useful and could be made available in our everyday life.\nWithin the last years industry picked up the idea of integrating\nubiquitous computing and already available products like remote\ncontrols for your house were developed and brought to the marked.\n\nIn spite of many applications and projects in the area of ubiquitous\nand pervasive computing the success is still far away. One of the main\nreasons is the lack of acceptance of and confidence in this technology.\nAlthough researchers and industry are working in all of these areas a\nforum to elaborate security, reliability and privacy issues, that\nresolve in trustworthy interfaces and computing environments for people\ninteracting within these ubiquitous environments is important. The user\nexperience factor of trust thus becomes a crucial issue for the success\nof a UbiComp application.\n\nThe goal of the TwUC 2010 workshop is to provide an international forum\nfor scientists, engineers and industry to address recent research\nresults and to present and discuss their ideas, theories, technologies,\nsystems, tools, applications, work in progress and experiences on all\ntheoretical and practical issues.\n\nTopics of Interest The conference program will include peer reviewed\nfull papers around but not limited to the following topics:\n\n- Usability and HCI in Ubiquitous Computing Environments\n\t- Methods and concepts to enhance and ensure usability in \n\t  UbiComp environments User experience in ubiquitous environ-\n\t  ments \n\t- User satisfaction and trust in ubiquitous environments\n\t- User perceived QoS, usability and quality of experience (QoE) \n\t- Trust and context in ubiquitous environments \n\t- Trust and the design of UbiComp appliances User centred \n\t  design in ubiquitous environments \n\t- User centred evaluation methods in ubiquitous environments \n- Security in Ubiquitous Computing Environments \n\t- Security issues and technologies \n\t- Usage policies \n\t- Identity and access \n\t- Threat and vulnerability\n\t- Malicious software in ubiquitous environments and its effect\n\t  on trust \n\t- Trusted computing and platforms \n- Reliability in Ubiquitous Computing Environments\n\t- Software design \n\t- Software quality and metrics \n\t- Methods and concepts to enhance and ensure reliability in \n\t  UbiComp applications and environments \n- Privacy in Ubiquitous Computing Environments \n\t- Issues and appliances on privacy in ubiquitous computing \n\t  environments \n\t- Data and information ownership \n\t- Souvereignity of social and technical methods for ensuring \n\t  confidentiality \n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n\nExtended paper submission deadline: July 31, 2010\n\nPaper submission         July 15, 2010 \nAcceptance Notification  August 30, 2010 \nCamera-Ready Papers      September 30, 2010 \nTwUC 2010 Workshop       November 8-10, 2010\n\nPUBLICATION\n\nAll accepted conference papers will be published together with the iiWAS2010 /\nMoMM2010 proceedings by the ACM digital library and the Austrian computer\nsociety books@ocg books series.

      <td>CALL FOR PAPERS\nSeventh International Conference on Data Integration in the Life Sciences\nin Gothenburg, Sweden\nAugust 25th - 27th 2010\n\nThe development and increasingly widespread deployment of high throughput experimental methods in the life sciences is giving rise to numerous large, complex and valuable data resources. This foundation of experimental data underpins the systematic study of organisms and diseases, which increasingly depend on the development of models of biological systems. The development of these models often requires integration of diverse experimental data resources; once constructed, the models themselves become data and present new integration challenges for tasks such as interpretation, validation and comparison.\nTopics of Interest\n\nDILS provides a forum for the discussion of emerging challenges for data integration in the life sciences, and the techniques that seek to address them. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n    * Architectures and data management techniques for the life sciences\n    * Query processing and optimization for biological data\n    * Biological Data sharing and update propagation\n    * Query formulation assistance for scientists\n    * Modeling of life sciences data\n    * Biological Metadata management\n    * Annotation in scientific data integration\n    * Provenance modeling and management for the life sciences\n    * Scientific Workflows and analysis pipelines\n    * Laboratory information management systems in biology\n    * Biological data quality and data cleaning\n    * Life sciences ontologies\n    * Semantic web for the life sciences\n    * Mining integrated life sciences data\n    * Text mining in the life science literature\n    * Machine learning in data integration in the life sciences\n    * Grid Computing and Grid technologies for the life sciences\n    * System prototypes for biology\n    * Commercial solutions in the life sciences\n    * Integration challenges presented by new kinds of biological data\n    * Scientific results arising from innovative data integration solutions\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\nAuthors are invited to submit original contributions of practical relevance and technical rigor, experience reports and demonstrations of relevance to data integration in the life sciences. DILS 2010 invites two types of papers:\n\n   1. Research papers (up to 16 pages).\n   2. System/Demonstration papers (up to 8 pages).\n\nPapers describing commercial solutions are welcome as long as sufficient detail of the problem and its technical solution are provided.\n\nPlease find detailed instructions for preparing the camera-ready copy of your paper in Springer's LNCS Author and Volume Editor Instructions.\n\n \n\nThe proceedings of DILS will be published by Springer in Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics.\n\n \n\nPlease submit your paper using the DILS 2010 EasyChair site:\nhttp://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dils2010\n\n \n\nAbstract submission deadline: 11 April 2010\n\nFull paper deadline: 18 April 2010\n\nAuthor Notification: 17 May 2010\n\nCamera Ready Copy Due: 7 June 2010</td>

Workshop Description\n         \nThis workshop aims at examining the relationship between linguistics and\nNLP and studying\n(1) the new methods in incorporating linguistic knowledge into statistical\n    systems to advance the state of the art of NLP, and\n(2) the feasibility of using NLP techniques to acquire linguistic knowledge\n    for a large number of languages and to assist linguistic studies.\n\n Since early 1990s, with the advancement of machine learning methods and the\navailability of data resources such as treebanks and parallel corpora,\ndata-driven approaches to NLP have made  significant progress. The success\nof such data-driven approaches has cast doubt on the relevance of\nlinguistics to NLP.  Conversely, NLP techniques are rarely used to help\nlinguistics studies. We believe that there is room to expand the\ninvolvement of linguistics in NLP, and likewise, NLP in linguistics, and\nbelieve that the cross-pollination of ideas between the disciplines can\ngreatly benefit both fields.\n\n One common approach to take advantage of linguistic knowledge is to train\na statistical system on linguistically annotated data such as treebanks.\nAnother approach is to represent linguistic knowledge as rules in a\nrule-based approach. This workshop is interested in research that goes\nBEYOND these common approaches and explores new methods in incorporating\nlinguistic knowledge into statistical systems or using statistical systems\nfor linguistic knowledge discovery.\n\n The workshop will consist of one invited talk, 2-3 panels, group discussion,\nand paper/poster sessions.\n\n\n2. Topics of Interest\n \n The workshop is interested in research that explores new methods in\nincorporating linguistic knowledge into statistical systems or using\nstatistical systems for linguistic knowledge discovery.\nThese include, but are not limited to, the following themes:\n\n  [T1] Research that shows awareness of particular linguistic phenomena\n       and its effects on statistical systems.\n\n       For instance, being aware of syntactic phenomena such as scrambling,\n       cross-serial dependencies and long-distance movement is very relevant\n       to parsing (e.g., earlier work on using different grammar formalisms\n       such as LTAG/CCG/HPSG/LFG to handle these phenomena or more recent\n       work on non-projective dependency parsing).\n\n       Similarly, being aware of word formation patterns (e.g., reduplication\n       in Chinese) or allomorphic variation patterns (e.g., vowel harmony in\n       Turkish) could help word segmentation and morphological analysis.\n    \n\n  [T2] New methods in incorporating linguistic knowledge into\n       statistical systems to improve the start of the art.\n      (e.g., as rules in a preprocessing step, as linguistic features in\n       a statistical system, as filters for pruning a search space, as priors\n       in an objective function).\n\n\n  [T3] Research that demonstrates the feasibility of creating NLP systems to\n       automatically acquire linguistic knowledge for a large number of\n       languages.\n\n       In order to make generalizations about language universals, linguists\n        need to gather information about as many individual languages as\n        possible.  However, knowledge about most languages is not complete.\n        Can we use NLP techniques to acquire knowledge (e.g., basic word\n        order, case marking, tense, aspect, word formation rules, etc.) for\n        hundreds of languages, which could help in the construction of\n        resources such as WALS (http://wals.info) (Haspelmath et al., 2005)?\n\n\n  [T4] Research that demonstrates the benefits of using NLP techniques to\n       help particular linguistic studies. For instance, given some language\n       data, can the categorization of languages into families be automated?\n       Can historical interactions between languages be identified\n       automatically (e.g., areal effects and borrowings, but beyond just\n       lexical borrowings)?  Can NLP tools run over corpora\n       of different dialects of the same language systematically identify\n       differences in the two dialects (e.g., not just word choice\n       differences, but also choice and frequency of particular\n       constructions)?\n      \n\n  The systems described in the paper should be properly evaluated and\n   compared with the start of the art.\n\n  On the submission form, please specify the theme that your paper falls into.\n\n \n\n3. Important dates:\n * Submission deadline: April 5, 2010\n * Notification: May 6, 2010\n * Camera-ready deadline: May 16, 2010\n * Workshop: July 16, 2010\n\n\n\n4. Submission Information\n\n The papers should report original and unpublished research on topics of\ninterest for the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented\nat the workshop, and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They\nshould emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should\nindicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.\n\n A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be presented or\nhave been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.\n\n\n4.1 Submission Format: All submissions must be electronic in PDF and must be\n     formatted using the ACL 2010 style files, which are available at\n     http://www.acl2010.org/authors.html\n\n4.2 Maximum Length: The maximum length of a submitted paper is\n     eight (8) pages of content, excluding references. One additional\n     page is allowed for the References section.  Thus, your PDF file\n     is limited to eight (8) pages of content and nine (9) pages in total.\n\n\n4.3 Anonymous Review: Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore,\n    the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations.\n    Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g.,\n    "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use\n    citations such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ...". Papers that do\n    not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.\n\n\n4.4 Double Submitting: Papers that have been or will be submitted to other\n    meetings or publications must provide this information on the START\n    online submission page. If NLPLing 2010 accepts a paper, authors must\n    notify the program chairs *immediately* indicating which meeting they\n    choose for presentation of their work. NLPLing 2010 cannot accept for\n    publication or presentation work that will be (or has been) published\n    elsewhere.\n\n\n4.5 Submission site: Authors must submit papers online at\n    https://www.softconf.com/acl2010/NLPLing/\n\n4.6 The submission deadline is April 5, 2010 23:59 PST. Papers\n    submitted after the deadline will not be reviewed.\n\n\n5. ACL mentoring service:\n\nACL is providing a mentoring (coaching) service for authors from regions of the world where English is less emphasized as a language of scientific exchange. Many authors from these regions, although able to read the scientific literature in English, have little or no experience in writing papers in English for conferences such as the ACL meetings. The service will be arranged as follows. A set of potential mentors will be identified by Mentoring Service Chairs BjÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¶rn GambÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¤ck (SICS, Sweden and NTNU, Norway) and Diana McCarthy (Lexical Computing Ltd., UK), who will organize this service for ACL 2010.

      <td>TextGraphs-5: Conference for Graph-based Methods for Natural Language Processing\n=================================================================\n\nWorkshop at ACL 2010\nAssociation for Computational Linguistics Conference\nUppsala, Sweden - July 16th, 2010\nhttp://www.textgraphs.org/ws10/\n\nDeadline for paper submission: Monday, April 5th, 2010\n\nTextGraphs is at its fifth edition! This shows that two seemingly distinct\ndisciplines,\ngraph theoretic models to computational linguistics, are in fact intimately\nconnected,\nwith a large variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications\nadopting efficient\nand elegant solutions from graph-theoretical framework.\n\nThe TextGraphs workshop series addresses a broad spectrum of research areas\nand\nbrings together specialists working on graph-based models and algorithms for\nnatural\nlanguage processing and computational linguistics, as well as on the\ntheoretical\nfoundations of related graph-based methods. This workshop series is aimed at\nfostering an exchange of ideas by facilitating a discussion about both the\ntechniques\nand the theoretical justification of the empirical results among the NLP\ncommunity\nmembers. Spawning a deeper understanding of the basic theoretical principles\ninvolved,\nsuch interaction is vital to the further progress of graph-based NLP\napplications.\n\n\nSpecial Theme: Graph Methods for Opinion Analysis\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the fifth edition of TextGraphs, we propose the special theme: "Graph\nMethods for\nOpinion Analysis". This choice is motivated by two important factors: (1)\nadvanced\nopinion analysis that aims to go beyond polarity recognition necessitates\nthe integration\nof syntactic, semantic and logic structures and (2) previous work in NLP has\nshown that\ngraph methods are very well suited to represent and exploit such structures\nin learning\nsystems.\n\nThe aim is to bring together researchers from graph theory and opinion\nanalysis in\norder to enable cross-fertilization of ideas. The proposed theme will\nencourage\npublication of early results and initiate discussions of issues in this\narea. We hope that\nthis will help to shape future directions for ambitious opinion analysis\nresearch and\nprovide a new, challenging problem motivation for research in graph\nalgorithms.\n\nFinally, as the field of opinion mining advances towards deeper analysis and\nmore\ncomplex systems, graphical approaches may become even more pertinent. For\ninstance,\ngraphs may be employed to capture opinion dynamics over time, or to model\ninteractions between opinion expressions across multiple modalities and, to\nrealize this,\nnew graph-based algorithms and inference methods may need to be developed.\n\n\nSuggested topics\n---------------------\n\nWe invite submissions on the following (but not limited to) general topics\n(including those\nfrom the special theme):\n* Graph methods for sentiment lexicon induction\n* Analysis of blog and web linking structures\n* Graph methods for sentiment/opinion propagation\n* Graph representation of data for opinion analysis\n* Synonym/antonym graphs and their usage to extrapolate semantic orientation\n* Social graphs and opinion analysis\n* Graph-based representations, acquisition and evaluation of lexicon and\nontology\n* Dynamic graph representations for NLP\n* Properties of lexical, semantic, syntactic and phonological graphs\n* Clustering-based algorithms\n* Application of spectral graph theory in NLP\n* Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning models based-on graphs\n* Dynamic graph representations for NLP\n* Comparative analysis of graph-based methods and traditional machine\nlearning\nTechniques for NLP applications\n* Kernel Methods for Graphs, e.g. random walk, tree and sequence kernels\n* Graph methods for NLP tasks, e.g. morpho-syntactic annotation, word sense\ndisambiguation, syntactic/semantic parsing\n* Graph methods for NLP applications, e.g. retrieval, extraction and\nsummarization of\ninformation\n* Semantic inference using graphs, e.g. question answering and text\nentailment\nrecognition\n\n\nImportant Dates\n--------------------\n\n* Deadline for paper submission: Monday, April 5th, 2010\n* Notification of acceptance: Thursday, May 6th, 2010\n* Submission of camera-ready articles: Friday, June 4th, 2010\n* Workshop at ACL 2010: Friday, July 16th, 2010\n\n\nOrganizing Committee\n---------------------------\n\n* Carmen Banea, University of North Texas,\n* Alessandro Moschitti, University of Trento,\n* Swapna Somasundaran, University of Pittsburgh,\n* Fabio Massimo Zanzotto, University of Rome "Tor Vergata"\n\n\nProgram Committee\n-------------------------\n\n* Giuseppe Carenini, University of British Columbia\n* Monojit Choudhury, Microsoft Research, India\n* William Cohen, Carnegie Mellon University\n* Andras Csomai, Google Inc.\n* Michael Gamon, Microsoft Research, Redmond\n* Thomas Gartner, Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and\nInformation Systems\n* Lise Getoor, University of Maryland\n* Andrew Goldberg, University of Wisconsin, Madison\n* Eduard Hovy, Information Sciences Institute\n* Richard Johansson, Trento University\n* Lillian Lee, Cornell University\n* Smaranda Muresan, Rutgers University\n* Fabrizio Sebastiani, Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologia dell'Informazione\n* Veselin Stoyanov, Cornell University\n* Carlo Strapparava, Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica\n* Hiroya Takamura, Tokyo Institute of Technology\n* Dragomir R.

This shows that two seemingly distinct, disciplines,, graph theoretic models to computational linguistics, are in fact intimately, connected,, with a large variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, adopting efficient, and elegant solutions from graph-theoretical framework., The TextGraphs workshop series addresses a broad spectrum of research areas, and, brings together specialists working on graph-based models and algorithms for, natural, language processing and computational linguistics, as well as on the, theoretical, foundations of related graph-based methods, This workshop series is aimed at, fostering an exchange of ideas by facilitating a discussion about both the, techniques, and the theoretical justification of the empirical results among the NLP, community, members, Spawning a deeper understanding of the basic theoretical principles, involved,, such interaction is vital to the further progress of graph-based NLP, applications., Special Theme: Graph Methods for Opinion Analysis, ----------------------------------------------------------------, For the fifth edition of TextGraphs, we propose the special theme: "Graph, Methods for, Opinion Analysis", This choice is motivated by two important factors: (1), advanced, opinion analysis that aims to go beyond polarity recognition necessitates, the integration, of syntactic, semantic and logic structures and (2) previous work in NLP has, shown that, graph methods are very well suited to represent and exploit such structures, in learning, systems., The aim is to bring together researchers from graph theory and opinion, analysis in, order to enable cross-fertilization of ideas, The proposed theme will, encourage, publication of early results and initiate discussions of issues in this, area, We hope that, this will help to shape future directions for ambitious opinion analysis, research and, provide a new, challenging problem motivation for research in graph, algorithms., Finally, as the field of opinion mining advances towards deeper analysis and, more, complex systems, graphical approaches may become even more pertinent, For, instance,, graphs may be employed to capture opinion dynamics over time, or to model, interactions between opinion expressions across multiple modalities and, to, realize this,, new graph-based algorithms and inference methods may need to be developed., Suggested topics, ---------------------, We invite submissions on the following (but not limited to) general topics, (including those, from the special theme):, * Graph methods for sentiment lexicon induction, * Analysis of blog and web linking structures, * Graph methods for sentiment/opinion propagation, * Graph representation of data for opinion analysis, * Synonym/antonym graphs and their usage to extrapolate semantic orientation, * Social graphs and opinion analysis, * Graph-based representations, acquisition and evaluation of lexicon and, ontology, * Dynamic graph representations for NLP, * Properties of lexical, semantic, syntactic and phonological graphs, * Clustering-based algorithms, * Application of spectral graph theory in NLP, * Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning models based-on graphs, * Dynamic graph representations for NLP, * Comparative analysis of graph-based methods and traditional machine, learning, Techniques for NLP applications, * Kernel Methods for Graphs, e.g, random walk, tree and sequence kernels, * Graph methods for NLP tasks, e.g, morpho-syntactic annotation, word sense, disambiguation, syntactic/semantic parsing, * Graph methods for NLP applications, e.g, retrieval, extraction and, summarization of, information, * Semantic inference using graphs, e.g, question answering and text, entailment, ...]</td>

We welcome papers encompassing either linguistics, literature, or both. Participants are asked to address communities, keeping in mind Benedict Anderson's theory of the "imagined community" or Edward Said's "imagined geographies". That is to say that participants should consider the idea that the community is an imagined space or population to which the individual belongs through their perception as part of the group. We aim to develop concepts of the community that encompass textual, visual, and/or aural media. We also wish to consider the development of language as a function of community identity.  \n\nThe literature keynote speaker will be Dr. Alec Hargreaves, Director of the Winthrop-King Institute for Contemporary French and Francophone Studies and Ada Belle Winthrop-King Professor of French at Florida State University. Dr. Hargreaves is the author, translator, and editor of several books and articles, including Multi-ethnic France: Immigration, Politics, Culture, and Society (2007), Memory, Empire, and Postcolonialism: Legacies of French Colonialism (2005), Post-colonial Cultures in France (1997).\n\nThe linguistics keynote speaker will be Dr. Gisele Chevalier, Professor of French Linguistics at the UniversitÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ© de Moncton.

encompassing either linguistics, literature, or both, Participants are asked to address communities, keeping in mind Benedict Anderson's theory of the "imagined community" or Edward Said's "imagined geographies", That is to say that participants should consider the idea that the community is an imagined space or population to which the individual belongs through their perception as part of the group, We aim to develop concepts of the community that encompass textual, visual, and/or aural media, We also wish to consider the development of language as a function of community identity,  , The literature keynote speaker will be Dr, Alec Hargreaves, Director of the Winthrop-King Institute for Contemporary French and Francophone Studies and Ada Belle Winthrop-King Professor of French at Florida State University, Dr, Hargreaves is the author, translator, and editor of several books and articles, including Multi-ethnic France: Immigration, Politics, Culture, and Society (2007), Memory, Empire, and Postcolonialism: Legacies of French Colonialism (2005), Post-colonial Cultures in France (1997)., The linguistics keynote speaker will be Dr, Gisele Chevalier, Professor of French

      <td>// NEW CALL FOR PAPERS //\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Logistics - Workshop at ECAI 2010  \n        Lisbon, Portugal, August 17, 2010\n\nhttp://www.sfbtr8.spatial-cognition.de/ailog-2010/\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n\nMay 11, 2010 (extended)\t\tPaper submission deadline\nJune 7, 2010\t\t                        Notification of acceptance\nJune 21, 2010\t\t                Camera-ready papers due\nAugust 17, 2010\t\t                Workshop at ECAI 2010\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nLogistics is concerned with the organization and control of processes in\nspace and time in order to transport or manufacture goods and the\ncoordination of the resulting flows of material and information, as well as\nmonetary flows. Complexity and dynamics of logistic networks have reached a\nlevel that more and more prevents the processes from being entirely\nobservable and fully controllable, caused by, e.g., a globalized economy, a\nshift from buyer's to seller's markets, and shorter product life cycles.\nThus, recent trends in logistics point towards solutions with distributed\nand self-organizing processes.\n\nSuch logistic networks are characterized by a wide variety of heterogeneous\nproperties, constraints, and requirements: temporal (very quickly, just in\ntime), economic (low cost, given budget), physical (smooth, secure travel),\ninformational (public, secure data), environmental (low energy,\necology-preserving). Different qualities or modalities need different\nrepresentations; transitions between different subsystems require interfaces\nbetween different representations, transformations of processes, and methods\nfor their selection; knowledge about situations and goals is crucial for the\nselection of the most suitable strategy; etc. This manifold set of demands\nand the emerging uncertainty requires the inclusion of methods from\nartificial intelligence and cognitive science. AIL-2010 addresses the use of\nthese AI methods in modern logistics.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTOPICS OF INTEREST\n\nThis workshop addresses researchers from logistics that utilize and develop\nAI approaches as well as researchers from AI that apply their work in\nlogistics or see possibilities to connect to logistic problems or methods.\n\nWe encourage contributions from the following research and application\nareas:\n\nPossible Research Areas:\t\n\nCoordination in Space and Time\nKnowledge Representation and Reasoning\nMulti Modal Interaction\nCognitive Robotics\nCognitive Modeling\nSpatial and Temporal Reasoning\nOntologies\nLogic and Constraint Programming\nAmbient Intelligence\nPlanning and Scheduling\nMulti Agent Systems\nData Mining\nCase-Based Reasoning\nMachine Learning\nHuman-machine Interfaces\n...\n\nPossible Application Areas:\n\nTransport logistics\nProduction planning and control\nAssembly and disassembly\nProcess modeling and monitoring\nProcess planning\nIntelligent manufacturing systems\nProduction Scheduling\nInventory organization and optimization\nAutomated inspection and quality control\nSupply chain management\nTraffic management\n...\n\nA special focus will be given to applying AI techniques in order to\nintegrate and interact with humans within the logistic process, may they be \nusers, system designers, analysts, or other stakeholders. Intelligent\nlogistic systems will instruct users; they communicate and explain their\nsituation and reasoning upon demand; they notify managers about anomalies or \nin case of an emergency; they engage in clarification dialogs upon\nmisunderstandings. The better the human interface becomes, the more we\nexpect logistic scenarios to become re-populated by users such that shared  \nhuman-machine scenarios may benefit from human expertise and intelligence   \nwhile operators are relieved from tedious automated routine. This way we\nmove from a de-centralized view of cooperating autonomous units to an\n"emancipated" society of logistic units interacting among themselves and\nwith human agents. We explicitly encourage submissions that tackle this\nchallenge.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubmitted papers must be in PDF format and follow the ECAI style guidelines.\nTechnical papers must not exceed a length of 6 pages.\n\nWe also welcome the submission of position papers or papers describing work\nin progress as short papers. Short papers must not exceed a length of 3\npages. If in doubt, submit a technical paper.\n\nFor submitting your paper, please use the Easychair online submission\nsystem at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ail2010 .\nThe paper submission deadline is May 7.\n\nSubmitted papers will be reviewed by at least two reviewers.

Such systems are subject to some paradigms including coordination due to the absence of centralization, and too much uncertainly result of hardware of software behaviors, heterogeneity and son forth. Indeed, such systems raise several issues not found in single processor systems. The main difficulty arises when considering dependability, security, adaptability and resources constrained computing. This area requires computing systems to run software in an efficient and trustworthy way. That is, in order to be able to design complex architectures in reasonable time, novel and effective design methodologies are needed to automatically build applications from high-level descriptions to take into account what needs to be deployed on hardware. To remedy this weakness, combining both model and component seems to be a very promising cocktail for building solutions to this problem.\n\nThe introduction of the component approach in the development of embedded systems allows facilitating their design by building through an assembly of existing components. Indeed, this approach provides a clear separation between the specification and implementation of components. Note however that in the context of component software, distributed architecture is significantly more demanding than that of traditional monolithic integrated solution. Model-driven engineering provides a very useful contribution for the design of distributed systems since it bridges the gap between design issues and implementation concerns. It helps the designer to concentrate on application structure and required behavior and it permits us to specify in a separate way non-functional requirements such as underlying execution infrastructure/middleware, dependability and security issues that are very important to guide the implementation process.\n\nThe supporting research in the distributed systems area includes system architecture, design techniques, testing, validation, proof of correctness, modeling, software reliability, operating systems, parallel processing and real/time processing. The goal of this workshop is to present significant works dealing with the design of distributed architecture and applications for embedded systems using both model-driven approach and component-based development. Architecture design involves defining how the architecture is specified.  Here, we focus on design tools with some view of the possible implementations frameworks providing run-time support to take full benefits of existing infrastructure to build flexible efficient distributed systems.\n\nLooking forward to your submissions</td>

      <td>Workshop for Negation and Speculation in Natural Language Processing</td>

      <td>CALL FOR PAPERS\n========================================\n\nWorkshop for Negation and Speculation in Natural Language Processing\n\nOrganised by the University of Antwerp and Saarland University\n\nJuly 10, 2010, Uppsala, Sweden\n\nhttp://www.clips.ua.ac.be/NeSpNLP2010\n\n========================================\n\nPapers are invited for the one-day workshop to be held in Uppsala on the 10th of July, 2010.\n\nIn recent years, research has yielded substantial progress in NLP tasks like NE recognition, WSD, parsing, semantic role labeling, and anaphora resolution among others. This has been in part supported by the organisation of  shared tasks, which provide annotated data, a definition of the task and an evaluation framework, motivating researchers to develop new techniques to tackle these tasks. Other tasks like paraphrasing, summarization or textual entailment have also progressed, but results are still relatively low because deep understanding of language - mapping meaning to meaning - is necessary. This raises methodological questions. Furthermore, large scale linguistic resources are still lacking.\n\nNegation and speculation are two phenomena involved in deep understanding of text. Both are related to expressing the factuality of statements, that is, expressing to which extent a statement is or is not a fact or a speculation. Negation turns an affirmative statement into negative (it rains/it does not rain). Speculation is used to express to which extent a statement is certain or speculated (it might rain/apparently, it will rain/ it is likely to rain/it is not clear whether it will rain/we suspect that it will rain).\n\nSCOPE AND TOPICS\n\nIn this workshop we aim at bringing together researchers working on negation and speculation from any area related to computational language learning and processing. The general goal of the workshop is to stimulate research about these topics. Specific goals are to describe the lexical aspects of negation and speculation, to define how the semantics of these phenomena can be modelled for computational purposes, to explore techniques aimed at learning the factuality of an statement, and to  analyse how the treatment of these phenomena affects the efficiency of NLP applications. Finally, the workshop aims at encouraging discussion about the need of deep linguistic processing as a way to take computational linguistics a step further.\n\nThe wokshop will address the following aspects of negation and speculation, although it will be open to other related topics:\n\n- Lexical  aspects of negation and speculation\n- Linguistic resources with information about negation and speculation: corpora, dictionaries, lexical databases \n- Descriptive analysis of negation and speculation cues\n- Negation and speculation across domains and genres\n- Negation and speculation in biomedical texts and biomedical text mining \n- Handling negation and speculation in NLP: dialogue systems, sentiment analysis, text mining, textual entailment, information extraction, machine translation, paraphrasing\n- Learning the scope of negation and speculation cues\n- Interaction of negation and speculation for evaluating the factuality of an statement\n- Corpora annotation: guidelines, bootstrapping techniques, quality assessment\n- Modelling factuality for computational purposes\n- Algorithms to learn negation and speculation\n- Structured prediction of negation and speculation \n- Joint learning of negation and speculation\n- Inference of factual knowledge\n\n\t\nSUBMISSIONS\n\nAuthors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop. All submissions must conform to the official ACL 2010 style guidelines and should not exceed 8 pages. Formatting instructions can be found in the ACL web page: http://www.acl2010.org/authors.html\n\nThe reviewing of the papers will be blind and the papers should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the program committee. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings with an ISBN.\n\nPapers should be submitted as PDF no later than May 14, 2010, via the following website:\n\t  \nhttp://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nespnlp2010\n\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n\nMay 14 - Deadline for workshop papers\nJune 15 - Notification of acceptance\nJune 25 - Camera-ready papers due \nJuly 10  - Workshop in Uppsala \n\nORGANISATION\n\t\nRoser Morante, CLiPS-LTG, University of Antwerp\nroser.morante [at] ua dot ac dot be\nCaroline Sporleder, MMCI / Computational Linguistics and Phonetics, Saarland University\ncsporled [at] coli dot uni-sb dot de\n\nPROGRAM COMMITTEE\n\nTimothy Baldwin - University Melbourne \nAljoscha Burchardt - TU Darmstadt \nClaire Cardie - Cornell University \nXavier Carreras - Technical University of Catalonia \nWendy W.

Specially, computation became an established third brand of science alongside theory and experiment. Scientists now need to access and exploit computational resources and databases that are geographically distributed through the use of high speed networks. Those resources must be modeled and managed in a similar way we model software development and data through software engineering processes and database techniques. In order to attack the next generation of scientific problems, multidisciplinary and distributed teams of scientists need to collaborate to make progress on these new challenges.\n\nCurrent advances in Software Engineering and Database research, including ontologies, scientific process/workflow modeling, semantic web services, software component management, grid computing, resource modeling, process and data provenance, data curation, among others can help to address these challenges. Several national and international projects around the world have been initiated to carry out research and innovation activities that will transform the goal of e-Science and Grid computing into a reality.\n\nThe IV e-Science workshop aims at bringing together recent developments in databases and software engineering towards a computerized infrastructure to accomplish science in the large, supporting the next generation of scientific research and experiments. The definition, execution and management of scientific experiments can no longer be developed in an ad-hoc manner. The topic of e-science or cyberinfrastructure is part of the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂGrand Challenges in Computer Science Research in Brazil ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 2006 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 2016ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ report from the Brazilian Computer Society.\n\nThis workshop serves as a forum to present, discuss and establish new partnership among scientists that participate in research and product/tool developments, and highlights related activities from the Brazilian and international community. The first three versions of the event were co-located with SBBD/SBES, and showed that there is an interesting audience on the theme.

----------------------------------------------------------------------, MOTIVATION, ----------------------------------------------------------------------, Over the past decades, we have seen a revolution in the way science and engineering has been conducted, Specially, computation became an established third brand of science alongside theory and experiment, Scientists now need to access and exploit computational resources and databases that are geographically distributed through the use of high speed networks, Those resources must be modeled and managed in a similar way we model software development and data through software engineering processes and database techniques, In order to attack the next generation of scientific problems, multidisciplinary and distributed teams of scientists need to collaborate to make progress on these new challenges., Current advances in Software Engineering and Database research, including ontologies, scientific process/workflow modeling, semantic web services, software component management, grid computing, resource modeling, process and data provenance, data curation, among others can help to address these challenges, Several national and international projects around the world have been initiated to carry out research and innovation activities that will transform the goal of e-Science and Grid computing into a reality., The IV e-Science workshop aims at bringing together recent developments in databases and software engineering towards a computerized infrastructure to accomplish science in the large, supporting the next generation of scientific research and experiments, The definition, execution and management of scientific experiments can no longer be developed in an ad-hoc manner, The topic of e-science or cyberinfrastructure is part of the

Business Process Management (BPM), including its service-oriented foundation, has been providing important technological support to improve organization competitiveness. In order to increase dynamism and competitiveness, BPM can benefit from reuse approaches and techniques at several stages of business process life cycle.\n\nThe 1st International Workshop on Reuse in Business Process Management will be dedicated to explore any type of reuse in the Business Process Management domain. Therefore, it will be a forum to discuss systematic reuse applied to BPM at its various levels:\n\n   1. the basic service-oriented foundation level ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ including issues such as service development, description, publication, discovery and selection;\n   2. the service composition level ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ encompassing service negotiation and service aggregation;\n   3. the management and monitoring upper level ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ including business process modeling, execution, monitoring, and contract establishment and enactment;\n   4. the Quality of Service and Semantics orthogonal level.\n\nMoreover, the impact of reuse on business- and service-oriented engineering as well as how it can help in the design of more high-quality process models are very important topics to be discussed in this workshop.\n\nDifferent existing reuse approaches and techniques can be extended to be applied to this fairly new domain, including: software product line or software product families; variability descriptors; design patterns such as feature modeling; aspect-orientation; and component-based development.

Conference Description\r\n\r\nThe Eleventh Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI-10) will provide an international forum for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences which concentrate on AI technologies and their applications in areas of social and economic importance for countries in the Pacific Rim.\r\n\r\nPRICAI2010 will be held at the Novetel Hotel in Daegu, Daegu is the fourth largest city in South Korea and has been the center of history, administration, education, and culture. The city has many cultural heritages and tourist attractions to well display Korean culture as well as complexes, department stores and large shopping malls.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Special session on (Semi-)automatic Creation of Language\r\n     Resources for Asian Languages\r\n\r\n As part of the conference, we are organizing a special session on\r\n  (Semi-)automatic Creation of Language Resources for Asian Languages.\r\n  Language resources (e.g., parallel/comparable corpora,\r\n  treebanks/Propbank/discourse treebanks, WordNet, FrameNet,\r\n  and dictionaries) are invaluable for natural language processing.\r\n  In the past two decades, there have been much effort in creating\r\n  such resources; however, many of the studies rely on manual annotation,\r\n  which is labor extensive and expensive.\r\n\r\n This special session aims to provide an opportunity for researchers\r\n  to share their ideas and efforts in automating the process of creating\r\n  language resources for Asian languages. Topics of interest include but\r\n  are not limited to:\r\n    * Automatic extraction of bilingual/comparable corpora from the Web\r\n    * Automatic compilation of bilingual/multi-lingual dictionaries\r\n    * (Semi-)automatic annotation of treebanks\r\n    * (Semi-)automatic creation of WordNet and FrameNet for a new language\r\n    * Automatic merging of language resources with different annotation\r\n        schemes and/or from different sources\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Important dates:\r\n * Submission deadline: March 31, 2010, 23:59 Pacific standard time (PST)\r\n * Notification: May 15, 2010\r\n * Camera-ready deadline: May 31, 2010\r\n * Conference date: Aug 30 - Sept 2, 2010\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Submission information\r\n\r\n The papers should report original and unpublished research on topics of\r\ninterest for the special session. Accepted papers are expected to be presented\r\nat the conference, and will be published in the conference proceedings. They\r\nshould emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should\r\nindicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.\r\n\r\n Papers for special sessions should be prepared in accordance with the\r\nPRICAI 2010 requirements (http://sc.snu.ac.kr/PRICAI10/PRICAI10Prep.html),\r\nand submitted through the PRICAI 2010 submission website\r\n(http://sc.snu.ac.kr/PRICAI10/PRICAI10Sub.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n5.

      <td>A CALL FOR PAPERS\nReliable and Autonomous Computational Science Conference\nIn Atlanta, Georgia, USA, on the 28th October 2010\n\nTheme &amp; Goal\n Increasing size and complexity of software and hardware systems makes it harder to ensure their reliability. At the same time, the issues of autonomous computing become more critical as we more and more rely on software systems in our daily life. Such complexity is getting even more critical with the ubiquitous computing of embedded devices and other pervasive systems. These trends make it necessary to support software engineers with a set of techniques and tools for developing reliable and autonomous software. To cope with the growing complexity, RACS focuses on is a place for highly original ideas about reliable and autonomous software. The purpose of the RACS 2010 is to bring together researchers from diverse communities who are interested in building reliable and autonomous computing technologies more robust, and to discuss and exchange experimental or theoretical results, novel design, work-in-progress, experience, case study, and trend-setting ideas.\n\n\nPapers\n Authors are invited to submit original papers in all areas of reliable software and autonomous computing. All papers will be fully refereed and undergo a blind review process by at least three referees. All accepted papers should be submitted in ACM 2-column camera-ready format for publication in the conference proceedings. The final version of the paper should not be more than 6 pages long; 4 extra pages will be allowed at additional cost. Selected papers will be recommended for publication in an International Journal as a special RACS 2010 section.\n\n\nWokshop Proposal\n In conjunction with the RACS 2010 conference, a number of workshops will be organized. Workshop proposals which should include "Title of the workshop", "Short bio of organizers", "A tentative list of TPC", and " A tentative website address" are to be sent to the workshop Chair(stjhang@suwon.ac.kr) by March 10, 2010.\n\n\nImportant Dates\n - May. 31, 2010  Paper Submission\n - Jun. 31, 2010  Author Notification\n - Aug. 31, 2010  Camera-Ready Copy</td>

      <td>[Apologies for multiple postings]\nCALL FOR PAPERS\n\nEvaluation of Information Filtering Systems in a Competitive Intelligence Framework Workshop\nWorkshop date: 22 May 2010\nHeld in conjunction with LREC 2010\n\nValetta, Malta\n\nAims\n\nThe constant growth of publicly available information has entailed a\nconsequently similar growth in the research areas devoted to the\nautomated organization of this information. In particular, Information\nFiltering systems have been developed to tackle the issues of many\napplications of business intelligence, from mail categorization to news\nrouting and technology watch. However, the theoretically challenging\nmodels of these systems have seldom been evaluated in real usage\ncontext. Indeed, standard evaluation benchmarks usually introduce\nartefacts that simplify the task.

      <td>35th International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science\n\nMFCS Symposia\n\nThe series of MFCS symposia, organized in rotation by Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic since 1972, has a long and well-established tradition. The symposia encourage high-quality research in all branches of theoretical computer science. Their broad scope provides an opportunity to bring together researchers who do not usually meet at specialized conferences. Quality papers presenting original research on theoretical aspects of computer science are solicited.\n\nThe 35th International Symposiums on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (MFCS 2010) is organized in parallel with the 19th EACSL Annual Conferences on Computer Science Logic (CSL 2010) at the same place. There will be common plenary sessions and social events, but the technical program and the proceedings are prepared independently.\n\nThe federated MFCS &amp; CSL 2010 conference is accompanied by several satellite workshops on more specialized topics.\n\nWORKSHOP DATES: 23 August 2010 - 27 August 2010\n\nPrincipal topics of interest\n\nalgorithmic game theory, algorithmic learning theory, algorithms and data structures (incl. sequential, parallel, distributed, approximation, graph, network, on-line, optimization), automata, grammars and formal languages, bioinformatics, complexity (structural and computational), computational geometry, computer-assisted reasoning, concurrency theory, cryptography and security, databases and knowledge-based systems, formal specifications and program development, foundations of computing, logic in computer science, mobile computing, models of computation, networks (incl. wireless, sensor, ad-hoc), parallel and distributed computing, quantum computing, semantics and verification of programs, theoretical issues in artificial intelligence.\n\n\nProgramme Committee\n\nLuca Aceto (Reykjavik), JiÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¦ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ­ AdÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡mek (Braunschweig), Christel Baier (Dresden), Patricia Bouyer-Decitre (Cachan), Sergio Cabello (Ljubljana), Witold Charatonik (Wroclaw), Jurek Czyzowicz (Quebec), Volker Diekert (Stuttgart), Rod Downey (Wellington), Fedor Fomin (Bergen), Gregory Gutin (London), Michel Habib (LIAFA), Edward A.

The increased complexity of the communication and networking infrastructure is making investigation of the crimes difficult. Clues of illegal activities are often buried in large volumes of data that need to be sifted through in order to detect crimes and collect evidence. The field of digital forensics is becoming very important for law enforcement, network security, and information assurance. This is a multidisciplinary area that encompasses multiple fields, including: law, computer science, finance, networking, data mining, and criminal justice. The applications of this technology are far-reaching which include law enforcement, disaster recovery, accounting frauds, homeland security, and information warfare. This conference brings together practitioners and researchers from diverse fields providing opportunities for business and intellectual engagement among attendees. The conference is organized by the College of Information Technology at Zayed University with the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering (ICST).\n\n***\n\nTOPICS\n\nTechnical papers describing original, previously unpublished research, not currently under review by another conference or journal, are solicited. The following topics highlight the conference theme:\n\n    * Financial Crimes (Money Laundering, Fraud, Identity Theft)\n    * Forensic Accounting (Accounting Fraud, Continuous Assurance, etc.)\n    * Digital Forensics Training &amp; Education\n    * Digital Forensics Process and Procedures\n    * Digital Forensics &amp; Law (e-Discovery &amp; Litigation Support, Incident Response, Evidence Handling)\n    * Cyber Crime Investigations\n    * Cyber Security &amp; Information Warfare\n    * Computer/Handheld Device &amp; Multimedia Forensics (Tools and Techniques)\n    * Forensics Standardization, Accreditation\n    * Cyber Criminal Psychology and Profiling\n\n\n***\n\nPUBLICATION\n\nThe conference proceedings will be published in the series of the Lecture Notes of ICST (LNICST) by Springer.\n\n***\n\nSUBMISSION\n\nFor submission guidelines, please visit http://d-forensics.org/submissiondetails.shtml\n\n***\n\nCALL FOR PRESENTATIONS\n\nSCOPE\n\nThe 2nd International ICST Conference on Digital Forensics and Cyber Crime (ICDF2C) is a unique conference encompassing not only technical, but also the social, legal, and business aspects of forensics. The forensics field is set to explode and the United Arab Emirates is in a prime position to take advantage of it. The United Arab Emirates has taken large governmental efforts in establishing UAE Cyber Laws, Digital Forensic Laboratories in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, governmental bodies specializing in security and has now introduced digital forensic research, development and education in the higher educational system. By bringing together both practitioners and researchers, we hope to benefit from understandings of current practice and the innovations that research has to offer.\n\nThis call for presenters is in addition to the call for papers. As opposed to research papers, the presentations will be focused on more applied topics. Presentation length should be from 1/2 to 1-hour. Presentations must be vendor neutral.\n\nFor submission guidelines, please visit http://d-forensics.org/callforpresentations.shtml.\n\n***\n\nTUTORIAL (tentative)\n\nAdvances in Digital Image Forensics\nby Dr. Nasir Memon, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA\n\nGiven the ease by which digital images can be created, altered, and manipulated with no obvious traces, digital image forensics has emerged as a research field with important implications for ensuring digital image credibility. This tutorial will provide an overview of recent developments in the field, focusing on three problems. First, collecting image evidence and reconstructing them from fragments with or without missing pieces. This involves sophisticated file carving technology. Second, attributing the image to a source, be it a camera, a scanner, or a graphically generated picture. The process entails associating the image with a class of sources with common characteristics (device model) or matching the image to an individual source device, for example a specific camera. Third, attesting to the integrity of image data. This involves image forgery detection to determine whether an image has undergone modification or processing after being initially captured.\n\nFor further information please visit http://d-forensics.org/tutorial.shtml\n\n***\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n\nPaper Submission Deadline: 1 May 2010\nNotification of Paper Acceptance: 15 June 2010\nCamera-Ready Paper Submission: 1 August 2010\nPresentation Proposal Submission Deadline: 1 June 2010\nNotification of Presentation Proposal Acceptance: 15 June 2010\nPresentation Submission Deadline: 1 August 2010\n\n***\n\nORGANIZING COMMITTEE\n\nGeneral Chair\nIbrahim Baggili, College of Information Technology, Zayed University, UAE\n\nFor a complete list of committee and board members, please visit http://d-forensics.org/orgcommittee.shtml</td>

      <td>INGRID 2010\n5th International Workshop on Distributed Cooperative Laboratories: Instrumenting the Grid\n\nMay 12-14, 2010\nPoznan, Poland\n\nA number of problems in science, industry and commerce, which require broad international cooperation, may be addressed by using sophisticated equipment and top-level expertise. Therefore, the development and dissemination of techniques and technologies that allow virtualized, remote and shared access to industrial or scientific instruments are essential for the progress of society. The possibility of using scientific or industrial equipment independently of their physical location helps towards equality of opportunity for and unification of communities, and subsequently provides new momentum for industry, science, and business.\nThe current edition of the Workshop goes beyond exploitation of remote instrumentation on the Grid. First of all, it focuses on new Remote Instrumentation (RI) aspects related to middleware architecture, high-speed networking, wireless Grid for acquisition devices and sensor networks, QoS provisioning for real-time control, measurement instrumentation and methodology. Additionally, it will provide knowledge about automation of mechanisms oriented to accompanying processes that are usually performed by a human. Another important point of this workshop is focusing on the future trends concerning RI systems development and actions related to standardization of remote instrumentation mechanisms.\nThe Workshop will be structured in technical sessions, some of which will be organized by leading researchers in the field, and will accommodate both invited and regular papers, selected on an open-call basis. INGRID 2010 allows also additional possibilities to be actively engaged in the conference program:\n1) Special sessions - proposals for special sessions are welcome. Please provide the session description (1-1.5 page) including a draft session program. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the International Program Committee.\n2) Extended abstracts - in alternative to full paper submission authors can provide an extended abstract (1-2 pages). The abstracts positively approved give a chance to make a presentation at the conference. A subsequent full paper will be reviewed independently, with a chance to add the paper to the post-workshop proceedings.\nContributions are solicited on all advanced research issues concerning the theme of the Workshop, and particularly in (but not limited to) the following topics:\n\nRemote instrumentation:\n       Remote instrumentation services\n       Virtual and remote laboratories\n       Virtualization technologies in remote instrumentation\n       Security issues for the remote control of devices\n       Architectures and use cases involving remote control of devices\n       Grid middleware extensions for remote control of instruments and devices\n       Interoperability of information systems for the remote control of devices\n       Building of communities around remote control of devices\n       Distributed synchronization and calibration\n       Present and future trends in RIS development\n       Standards and standardization processes for RIS systems\n\nTele-working environments and e-learning:\n       Tele-working environments and tele-presence\n       Tele-services, tele-diagnosis and tele-robotics\n       Tele-communities and their social impact\n       Collaborative work in virtual engineering environments\n       Mixed-Reality environments for education and training\n       Demands in education and training, e-learning, b-learning, m-learning and       ODL\n       Innovative organizational and educational concepts for remote engineering\n\nDistributed data management:\n       Management of large scientific data sets\n       Networking solutions in support of scientific data transport\n       Distributed data acquisition in sensor networks\n       Data management in Wireless Sensor Networks\n       Metadata and advanced information systems for instruments and sensors\n\nGrid integration of experimental and computational resources:\n       Workflow management for large-scale experiments\n       Visualization techniques\n       Grid integration of experimental and computational processes\n       Human computer interfaces, usability, reusability, accessibility\n       Deployment of large scale applications for online engineering\n       Supporting interactive applications in the grid environment\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n       Paper submission:               Feb. 28, 2010\n       Special session proposals:      Feb. 28, 2010\n       Acceptance notification:        March 31, 2010\n       Camera ready copy due:  April 15, 2010\n\nPAPER SUBMISSION GUIDELINES\nManuscripts to be considered as regular papers should be original work limited to 20 double-spaced pages.\nExtended Abstracts should be limited to 2 double-spaced pages.\nAny paper submitted to the Workshop must not have been published in or submitted to other technical conferences/journals.\nOnly electronic submissions will be accepted.

      <td>#################################################################\n                IEEE WETICE 2010 \n         1st International Workshop on\n     Collaborative Modeling and Simulation \n                CALL FOR PAPERS \n################################################################# \n\nJune 28 - June 30, 2010, Larissa (Greece) \nhttp://www.sel.uniroma2.it/CoMetS10 \n\n################################################################# \n# Papers Due: *** March 2, 2010 *** \n# Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings \n# by the IEEE Computer Society Press and indexed by EI. \n################################################################# \n\nModeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) is increasingly becoming a central \nactivity in the design of new systems and in the analysis of \nexisting systems because it enables designers and researchers to \ninvestigate systems behavior through virtual representations. For \nthis reason, M&amp;S is gaining a primary role in many industrial and \nresearch fields, such as space, critical infrastructures, \nmanufacturing, emergency management, biomedical systems and \nsustainable future. However, as the complexity of the \ninvestigated systems increases and the types of investigations \nwidens, the cost of M&amp;S activities increases because of the more \ncomplex models and of the communications among a wider number and \nvariety of M&amp;S stakeholders (e.g., sub-domain experts, simulator \nusers, simulator engineers, and final system users). To address \nthe increasing costs of M&amp;S activities, collaborative \ntechnologies must be introduced to support these activities by \nfostering the sharing and reuse of models, by facilitating the \ncommunications among M&amp;S stakeholders, and more generally by \nintegrating processes, tools and platforms. \n\nAside from seeking applications of collaborative technologies to \nM&amp;S activities, the workshop seeks innovative contributions that \ndeal with the application of M&amp;S practices to the design of \ncollaborative environments. These environments are continuously \nbecoming more complex and therefore their design requires \nsystematic approaches to meet the required quality of \ncollaboration. This is important for two reasons: to reduce \nrework activities on the actual collaborative environment, and to \nmaximize the productivity and the quality of the process the \ncollaborative environment supports. M&amp;S offers the methodologies \nand tools for such investigations and therefore it can be used to \nimprove the quality of collaborative environments. \n\nA non-exhaustive list of hi-level topics includes: \n\n* collaborative environments for M&amp;S \n* agent-based M&amp;S \n* collaborative distributed simulation \n* net-centric M&amp;S \n* web-based M&amp;S \n* model sharing and reuse \n* model building and evaluation \n* modeling and simulation of business processes \n* modeling for collaboration \n* simulation-based performance evaluation of collaborative \n  networks \n* model-driven simulation engineering \n* domain specific languages for the simulation of collaborative \n  environments \n* domain specific languages for collaborative M&amp;S \n\nTo stimulate creativity, however, the workshop maintains a wider \nscope and invites interested researchers to present contributions \nthat offer original perspectives on collaboration and M&amp;S. \n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ \nOn-Line Submissions and Publication \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ \n\nCoMetS'10 intends to bring together researchers and practitioners \nto discuss key issues, approaches, open problems, innovative \napplications and trends in the workshop research area. \n\nPapers should contain original contributions not published or \nsubmitted elsewhere. Papers up to six pages (including figures, \ntables and references) can be submitted. Papers should follow the \nIEEE format, which is single spaced, two columns, 10 pt \nTimes/Roman font. All submissions should be electronic (in PDF) \nand will be peer-reviewed by at least three program committee \nmembers. \n\nFull papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the \nproceedings, published by the IEEE Computer Society Press (IEEE \napproval pending).

These services can then be mixed and matched to\ncreate entirely new applications or to deliver new business capabilities.\nAs a concept, SOA is not new. It is a product of the evolution of IT\narchitecture and distributed computing concepts. However, it has only become\na reality over the last few years because of the emergence of standards and\nmaturation of supporting technology. The Internet has played a significant\nrole in the evolution of these standards, allowing (Web) services to\ninteroperate globally within and across the boundaries of large and small\norganizations. Without standards, it would be difficult for services to\ncommunicate and interact with each other. Consequently, the aforementioned\nsharing, reuse and combination of services to create business processes on\nan as-needed basis would not be possible.\nAt its core, service orientation is about aligning technology to efficiently\nand flexibly support the process and performance needs of the business.\nIt means a technology capability that:\nÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢    Meets the process and performance needs of the business\nÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢    Adapts quickly to changing business needs\nÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢    Can incorporate new technologies to deliver new business capability\nUnder conventional approaches to building IT systems, an application typically\nsupports a pre-defined set of business requirements (such as sales orders or\naccounting). Whenever a new business need arises, organizations build or install\nnew applications. This is highly inefficient especially when the different\napplications perform similar tasks and share the same data. Hence, SOA provides\nboth IT flexibility and business agility.\nSOA is an industrial reality with projects and commercial offers. Moreover, related\nadvanced topics are numerous as : Cloud Computing, Grid, Green IT, Software as a\nService, Aspect Based Services, service based Multi Agent Systems ...\nThis first workshop on Recent  Trends  in SOA Based Information  Systems  provides\na forum for researchers and practitioners to present results, applications, and\nexperiences in software based on SOA and Web services. The organizing committee\nwelcomes high quality contributions that describe original and unpublished works\nin the field of services-based application engineering in terms of design, development,\ntesting, and deployment, Enterprise Service Bus ...\n\n\n===============================================================\n\nThe workshop welcomes three types of submissions:\n\n1.

Each service implements a discrete piece of, business functionality, These services can then be mixed and matched to, create entirely new applications or to deliver new business capabilities., As a concept, SOA is not new, It is a product of the evolution of IT, architecture and distributed computing concepts, However, it has only become, a reality over the last few years because of the emergence of standards and, maturation of supporting technology, The Internet has played a significant, role in the evolution of these standards, allowing (Web) services to, interoperate globally within and across the boundaries of large and small, organizations, Without standards, it would be difficult for services to, communicate and interact with each other, Consequently, the aforementioned, sharing, reuse and combination of services to create business processes on, an as-needed basis would not be possible., At its core, service orientation is about aligning technology to efficiently, and flexibly support the process and performance needs of the business., It means a technology capability that:,

      <td>CALL FOR PAPERS\r\n\r\nSPONSORS\r\n\r\nSponsored by ICST\r\nTechnically co-sponsored by CREATE-NET\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSCOPE\r\n\r\nWith the rapid growth of the Internet as well as the increasing demand for broadband services, access networks have been receiving growing investments in recent years. This has led to a massive network deployment with the goal of eliminating the bandwidth bottleneck between end-users and the network core. Today many diverse technologies are being used to provide broadband access to end users. The architecture and performance of the access segment (local loop, wired and wireless access networks, and even home networks) are getting increasing attention for ensuring quality of service of diverse broadband applications. Moreover, most access lines will no longer terminate on a single device, thus leading to the necessity of having a home network designed for applications that transcend simple Internet access sharing among multiple personal computers and enable multimedia support. Therefore, the access network and its home portion have become a hot investment pool from both a financial as well as a research perspective.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the annual International Conference on Access Networks (ACCESSNETS) is to provide a forum that brings together scientists and researchers from academia, as well as managers and engineers from the industry and government organizations to meet and exchange ideas and recent work on all aspects of access networks and how they integrate with their in-home counterparts. ACCESSNETS 2010 is the fifth edition of this exciting event, which will be held in Budapest, Hungary, on 3-5 November 2010. The conference will consist of technical sessions, industry track, workshops and panels. The technical sessions will present original and fundamental research advances while the industry track, workshops and panels will focus on development, application and related business issues in this hot and exciting area.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTOPICS\r\n\r\nThe conference solicits original technical papers that were not previously published and are not currently under review for publication elsewhere.

      <td>First Call for Papers\n\nCognitive Aspects of the Lexicon Workshop\n2nd SIGLEX endorsed COLING Workshop (August 22, 2010, Beijing)  \n\n\nSubmission deadline: May 30, 2010\n\n================================================================================\n\nAIMS and TARGET AUDIENCE\n\nThe aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers involved in the construction and application of electronic dictionaries to discuss modifications of existing resources in line with the users' needs, thereby fully exploiting the advantages of the digital form. Given the breadth of the questions, we welcome reports on work from many perspectives, including but not limited to: computational lexicography, psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, language learning and ergonomics.\n\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nWhenever we read a book, write a letter or launch a query on a search engine, we always use words, the shorthand labels and concrete forms of abstract notions (concepts, ideas and more or less well specified thoughts). Yet, words are not only vehicles to express thoughts, they are also means to conceive them. They are mediators between language and thought, allowing us to move quickly from one idea to another, refining, expanding or illustrating our possibly underspecified thoughts. Only words have these unique capabilities, which is why they are so important.\n\nObviously, a good dictionary should contain many entries and a lot of information associated with each one of them. Yet, the quality of a dictionary depends not only on coverage, but also on accessibility of information. Access strategies vary with the task (text understanding vs. text production) and the knowledge available at the moment of consultation (word, concept, speech sounds). Unlike readers who look for meanings, writers start from them, searching for the corresponding words. While paper dictionaries are static, permitting only limited strategies for accessing information, their electronic counterparts promise dynamic, proactive search via multiple criteria (meaning, sound, related words) and via diverse access routes. Navigation takes place in a huge conceptual lexical space, and the results are displayable in a multitude of forms (e.g. as trees, as lists, as graphs, or sorted alphabetically, by topic, by frequency).\n\nMany lexicographers work nowadays with huge digital corpora, using language technology to build and to maintain the lexicon. But access to the potential wealth of information in dictionaries remains limited for the common user. Yet, the new possibilities of electronic media in terms of comfort, speed and flexibility (multiple inputs, polyform outputs) are enormous. Computational resources are not prone to the same limitations as paperbound dictionaries. The latter were limited in scope, being confined to a specific task (translation, synonyms, ...) due to economical reasons, but this limitation is not justified anymore.\n\nToday we can perform all tasks via one single resource, which may comprise a dictionary, a thesaurus and even more. The goal of this workshop is to perform the groundwork for the next generation of electronic dictionaries, that is, to study the possibility of integrating the different resources, as well as to explore the feasibility of taking the user's needs, knowledge and access strategies into account.\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nFor this workshop we invite papers including but not limited to the following topics:\n\n    Conceptual input of a dictionary user. What is in the authors' minds when they are generating a message and looking for a word? Do they start from partial definitions, i.e. underspecified input (bag of words), conceptual primitives, semantically related words, something akin to synsets, or something completely different? What does it take to bridge the gap between this input, incomplete as it may be, and the desired output (target word)?\n\n    Organizing the lexicon and indexing words. Concepts, words and multi-word expressions can be organized and indexed in many ways, depending on the task and language type. For example, in Indo-European languages words are traditionally organized in alphabetical order, whereas in Chinese they are organized by semantic radicals and stroke counts. The way words and multi-word expressions are stored and organized affects indexing and access. Since knowledge states (i.e. knowledge available when initiating search) vary greatly and in unpredictable ways, indexing must allow for multiple ways of navigation and access. Hence the question: what organizational principles allow the greatest flexibility for access?\n\n    NLP applications: Contributors can also demonstrate how such enhanced dictionaries, once embedded in existing NLP applications, can boost performance and help solve lexical and textual-entailment problems, such as those evaluated in SEMEVAL 2007, or, more generally, generation problems encountered in the context of summarization, question-answering, interactive paraphrasing or translation.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n\n        * Deadline for paper submissions: May 30, 2010\n        * Notification of acceptance:  June 30, 2010\n        * Camera-ready papers due: July 10, 2010\n        * Cogalex workshop:  August 22, 2010\n\n\n\nSUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS\n\nAuthors are invited to submit original, unpublished work on any of the topic areas of the workshop. As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references revealing the authors' identity, should be avoided. Further details concerning the paper submission will be announced closer to the May 30 submission deadline.\n\n\nRELATED CONFERENCES in BEIJING\n\nNext to COLING 2010 there are two conferences workshop participants may be interested in:\n\n    The 7th International Conference on Cognitive Science (ICCS) which takes place August 17 to 20, 2010, just before COLING. It is our hope that this unique opportunity will foster scientific exchange between the scientific communities of Computational Linguistics and Cognitive Science. The ICCS' venue is the China National Convention Center (CNCC) which is close to COLING's site, the Beijing International Convention Center (BICC), located on the other side of the China National Stadium ('Bird Nest').\n\n\nPROGRAM COMMITTEE\n\n    -    Slaven Bilac (Google Tokyo, Japan)\n    -    Pierrette Bouillon (ISSCO, Geneva, Switzerland)\n    -    Dan Cristea (University of Iasi, Romania)\n    -    Katrin Erk (University of Texas, USA)\n    -    Olivier Ferret (CEA LIST, France)\n    -    Thierry Fontenelle (EU Translation Centre, Luxemburg)\n    -    Sylviane Granger (Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium)\n    -    Gregory Grefenstette (Exalead, Paris, France)\n    -    Ulrich Heid (IMS, University of Stuttgart, Germany)\n    -    Erhard Hinrichs (University of Tuebingen, Germany)\n    -    Graeme Hirst (University of Toronto, Canada)\n    -    Ed Hovy (ISI, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA)\n    -    Chu-Ren Huang (Hongkong Polytechnic University, China)\n    -    Terry Joyce (Tama University, Kanagawa-ken, Japan)\n    -    Philippe Langlais (DIRO/RALI, University of Montreal, Canada)\n    -    Marie Claude L'Homme (University of Montreal, Canada)\n    -    Verginica Mititelu (RACAI, Bucharest, Romania)\n    -    Alain Polguere (Nancy-Universite &amp; ATILF CNRS, France)\n    -    Reinhard Rapp (University of Tarragona, Spain)\n    -    Sabine Schulte im Walde (University of Stuttgart, Germany)\n    -    Gilles Serasset (IMAG, Grenoble, France)\n    -    Serge Sharoff (University of Leeds, UK)\n    -    Anna Sinopalnikova (FIT, BUT, Brno, Czech Republic)\n    -    Carole Tiberius (Institute for Dutch Lexicology, The Netherlands)\n    -    Takenobu Tokunaga (TITECH, Tokyo, Japan)\n\nWEBSITE, WORKSHOP ORGANIZERS and CONTACT PERSONS\n\n        * http://pageperso.lif.univ-mrs.fr/~michael.zock/cogalex-2.html\n\n        * Michael Zock (LIF-CNRS, Marseille, France), michael.zock AT lif.univ-mrs.fr\n        * Reinhard Rapp (University of Tarragona, Spain), reinhard.rapp AT urv.cat\n\nWeb:   \nhttp://www.lif.univ-mrs.fr/spip.php?article268\n</td>

What does it take to bridge the gap between this input, incomplete as it may be, and the desired output (target word)?,     Organizing the lexicon and indexing words, Concepts, words and multi-word expressions can be organized and indexed in many ways, depending on the task and language type, For example, in Indo-European languages words are traditionally organized in alphabetical order, whereas in Chinese they are organized by semantic radicals and stroke counts, The way words and multi-word expressions are stored and organized affects indexing and access, Since knowledge states (i.e, knowledge available when initiating search) vary greatly and in unpredictable ways, indexing must allow for multiple ways of navigation and access, Hence the question: what organizational principles allow the greatest flexibility for access?,     NLP applications: Contributors can also demonstrate how such enhanced dictionaries, once embedded in existing NLP applications, can boost performance and help solve lexical and textual-entailment problems, such as those evaluated in SEMEVAL 2007, or, more generally, generation problems encountered in the context of summarization, question-answering, interactive paraphrasing or translation., IMPORTANT DATES,         * Deadline for paper submissions: May 30, 2010,         * Notification of acceptance:  June 30, 2010,         * Camera-ready papers due: July 10, 2010,         * Cogalex workshop:  August 22, 2010, SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS, Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished work on any of the topic areas of the workshop, As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and affiliations, Furthermore, self-references revealing the authors' identity, should be avoided, Further details concerning the paper submission will be announced closer to the May 30 submission deadline., RELATED CONFERENCES in BEIJING, Next to COLING 2010 there are two conferences workshop participants may be interested in:,     The 7th International Conference on Cognitive Science (ICCS) which takes place August 17 to 20, 2010, just before COLING, It is our hope that this unique opportunity will foster scientific exchange between the scientific communities of Computational Linguistics and Cognitive Science, The ICCS' venue is the China National Convention Center (CNCC) which is close to COLING's site, the Beijing International Convention Center (BICC), located on the other side of the China National Stadium ('Bird Nest')., PROGRAM COMMITTEE,     -    Slaven Bilac (Google Tokyo, Japan),     -    Pierrette Bouillon (ISSCO, Geneva, Switzerland),     -    Dan Cristea (University of Iasi, Romania),     -    Katrin Erk (University of Texas, USA),     -    Olivier Ferret (CEA LIST, France),     -    Thierry Fontenelle (EU Translation Centre, Luxemburg),     -    Sylviane Granger (Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium),     -    Gregory Grefenstette (Exalead, Paris, France),     -    Ulrich Heid (IMS, University of Stuttgart, Germany),     -    Erhard Hinrichs (University of Tuebingen, Germany),     -    Graeme Hirst (University of Toronto, Canada),     -    Ed Hovy (ISI, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA),     -    Chu-Ren Huang (Hongkong Polytechnic University, China),     -    Terry Joyce (Tama University, Kanagawa-ken, Japan),     -    Philippe Langlais (DIRO/RALI, University of Montreal, Canada),     -    Marie Claude L'Homme (University of Montreal, Canada),     -    Verginica Mititelu (RACAI, Bucharest, Romania),     -    Alain Polguere (Nancy-Universite &amp; ATILF CNRS, France),     -    Reinhard Rapp (University of Tarragona, Spain),     -    Sabine Schulte im Walde (University of Stuttgart, Germany),     -    Gilles Serasset (IMAG, Grenoble, France),     -    Serge Sharoff (University of Leeds, UK),     -    Anna Sinopalnikova (FIT, BUT, Brno, Czech Republic),     -    Carole Tiberius (Institute for Dutch Lexicology, The Netherlands),     -    Takenobu Tokunaga (TITECH, Tokyo, Japan), WEBSITE, WORKSHOP ORGANIZERS and CONTACT PERSONS,         * http://pageperso.lif.univ-mrs.fr/~michael.zock/cogalex-2.html,         * Michael Zock (LIF-CNRS, Marseille, France), michael.zock AT lif.univ-mrs.fr,         * Reinhard Rapp (University of Tarragona, Spain), reinhard.rapp AT urv.cat, Web:   , http://www.lif.univ-mrs.fr/spip.php?article268]</td>

Understanding the role of ontology technologies like knowledge representation, automated reasoning, dynamic classification and consistency checking in these fields is crucial to leverage the development of such disciplines. Thus, we highlight the following open questions: How can the scientific and technical results around ontologies, ontology languages and their corresponding reasoning technologies be used fruitfully in MDE? What is the role of ontologies in supporting model transformation or traceability? How can ontologies improve designing DSLs? Are current query languages able to query both kinds of models? \r\n\r\nDiscussions about these and related questions will be supported by this workshop. TWOMDE2010 aims at providing a forum for discussing the application of different aspects of ontologies to enhance model-driven engineering.\r\n\r\nThe intended audience embraces members of the modeling community with experience or interest in model-driven engineering and in Knowledge Representation. Specifically, but not only, the participation of experts in technologies related with UML, MOF, ATL, QVT, RDF or OWL is highly welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPICS OF INTEREST\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nTWOMDE2010 is the exclusive forum at a MDE conference to address the application of ontologies in model-driven development.

      <td>First IEEE International Workshop on Engineering Mobile Service Oriented Systems (EMSOS) collocated with SCC 2010\n\nMiami, Florida, USA, held between July 5-10, 2010 in conjunction with ICWS 2010, SCC 2010, and CLOUD 2010\n \nAims and Scope\n\nMobile systems are characterized with autonomous, dynamically adaptable, and heterogeneous components collaborating in open intra-organizational environments to provide solutions. Next generation phones, mobile networks, mobile cloud computing are a few examples of mobile applications where code, users and their devices continuously move. Evolving requirements, such as reliability, security, scalability, performance and privacy, from fixed to mobile settings, has revealed new and important challenges. This is due to the behavioural constraints that mobility poses, and that were not faced in traditional distributed settings. Examples include: dynamic network topology, changes in location, constrained resource availability, communication protocols heterogeneity, unstable connectivity, and so forth. The service-oriented paradigm is a promising approach for engineering open, dynamic and distributed systems. There are a plethora of research issues on how mobile systems can make use of service oriented engineering techniques.\n\nThe EMSOS Workshop aims to bring together researchers from academia and industry, as well as practitioners in the area of engineering services in mobile environments in order to provide a forum where recent research results can be presented and discussed. The aim is to understand open issues in the software engineering area of services applied in mobile environments, and to build a community of researchers and practitioners willing to collaborate on these issues.\n\nThe workshop seeks contributions that address theoretical foundations, important issues, recent developments, applications, methods, practical techniques, tools, empirical studies, experience, and lessons learned related to engineering mobile service oriented systems. \n\nList of Topics\n\nThe list of topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n    * Mobile services in the cloud\n    * Business Process Modelling and Requirements of services for mobility;\n    * Model-Driven Service Engineering for mobile systems;\n    * Software Product Line and mobility\n    * Aspect-Oriented and Service Oriented Engineering for mobile environments;\n    * Service-Oriented Architectures and mobility\n    * Modelling, developing, deploying, configuring and maintaining mobile services\n    * Semantics and Formal methods for mobile service oriented systems\n    * Enterprise Service Buses and Middleware-induced service oriented architectures for mobile environments\n    * Security, trust and privacy issues in service oriented systems for mobile environments;\n    * Dependability issues in service-oriented mobile systems\n    * Service Discovery and publication in mobile systems\n    * Service Level Agreements for mobility\n    * Composing and orchestrating services in mobile environments\n    * Service oriented testing for mobility\n    * Maintenance and evolution of mobile systems using service oriented engineering;\n    * Economics of developing and evolving mobile services,\n    * Context-Aware and Autonomic Computing in Service Oriented mobile environments\n    * Tool support\n    * Empirical, Industrial and Experience studies -Applying Service Oriented Engineering in mobile domains such as wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, mobile telephony energy saving, climate change, healthcare, etc. \n\nPaper Submission\n\nAuthors are invited to submit UNPUBLISHED research and industrial papers in three paper categories: 6 page (full papers), 4 page (short papers), and 2 page (position papers) of double column text using single spaced 10 point size on 8.5 x 11 inch pages, as per IEEE 8.5 x 11 manuscript guidelines (http://www.computer.org/cspress/instruct.htm).\n\nAuthors should submit a Word or PDF files using the online submission and review system.

This brings \nabout a lot of opportunities and challenges for mobile wireless networking.  \n   \nWith the emerging wireless technologies, mobility has more generic \nmeaning than just node movement as in the traditional sense. It also \nmeans that when the operational environment changes (such as frequency \nand power), a node or the network adapts to the environmental changes, \nwhich requires the cognitive capability. On one hand, it is of critical \nimportance that seamless, low latency and transparent services are \nprovided to the users, via potentially multiple heterogeneous wireless \ntechnologies or opportunistic spectrum access involved during the \ncourse of node movement or environmental changes. Environment cognizance, \nspectrum-aware mobility management, and vertical handoff become critical \ncomponents in the solution space. On the other hand, host and network \nmobility also affects the performance of network protocols significantly, \nwhile at the same time allows opportunistic interconnections of heterogeneous \nnetworks, which in turn makes mobility adaptability an important design issue. \nThis asks the design of wireless architectures, protocols, spectrum management, \nand mobility management mechanisms to be revisited. \n\nCohesive with the main theme of Globecom 2010 --- "moving into the age \nof mobile interactivity", the workshop welcomes original submissions from \nboth researchers and practitioners that explore recent advances in \narchitecture, system, protocol, modeling, and testbed design, as well as \nemerging applications and standards to enable seamless mobility and \ntransparency in wireless networks. Topics of interest include, but are \nnot limited to:\n\n- Architecture, system, and protocol design for seamless roaming support \n  in wireless networks\n\n- Spectrum cognition and agility associated with mobility \n\n- Vertical handoff and seamless integration of heterogeneous networks\n\n- Location tracking, positioning, and address management\n\n- Mobility modeling and theoretical/experimental validation\n\n- Mobility impact on routing, resource/power/QoS management\n\n- Adaptive and resilient protocols for seamless mobility support at all layers, \n  as well as cross-layer approaches\n\n- Security and privacy issues under mobility and network access\n\n- Emerging standards and applications on mobility\n\n- Simulation/testbed tools and experimental measurements\n\n\nImportant Dates:\n================\n\nSubmission deadline        :                  July 11, 2010\nNotification of acceptance :               August 13, 2010\nCamera-ready version       :               August 31, 2010\nWorkshop Date              :             December 10, 2010\n\n\nSubmission Details:\n===================\n\nThe workshop will only accept original, previous unpublished papers. Prospective \nauthors are encouraged to submit an IEEE conference style paper up to 5 pages \n(including all text, figures, and references) through EDAS submission system, \nbut one additional page will be allowed with additional publication fee. \n\nAn accepted paper must be registered before the registration deadline. An \naccepted paper must be presented at the workshop. Failure to register before \nthe deadline will result in automatic withdrawal of the paper from the workshop \nproceedings and the program. \n\nAll accepted and presented papers will be included in the IEEE GLOBECOM \nproceedings and IEEE digital library. GLOBECOM has the right to remove an \naccepted and registered but not presented paper from the IEEE digital library.\n\nExtended version of selected accepted papers will be published in a special\nissue of Journal of Communications (JCM).\n\n\nOrganization Committee:\n=======================\n\nSubir Das,         Telcordia Technologies, Inc. \n\nJing Deng,         University of North Carolina at Greensboro \n\nNada Gomie,        National Institute of Standards and Technology\n \nJason H.

Architecture, system, and protocol design for seamless roaming support ,   in wireless networks, - Spectrum cognition and agility associated with mobility , - Vertical handoff and seamless integration of heterogeneous networks, - Location tracking, positioning, and address management, - Mobility modeling and theoretical/experimental validation, - Mobility impact on routing, resource/power/QoS management, - Adaptive and resilient protocols for seamless mobility support at all layers, ,   as well as cross-layer approaches, - Security and privacy issues under mobility and network access, - Emerging standards and applications on mobility, - Simulation/testbed tools and experimental measurements, Important Dates:, ================, Submission deadline        :                  July 11, 2010, Notification of acceptance :               August 13, 2010, Camera-ready version       :               August 31, 2010, Workshop Date              :             December 10, 2010, Submission Details:, ===================, The workshop will only accept original, previous unpublished papers, Prospective , authors are encouraged to submit an IEEE conference style paper up to 5 pages , (including all text, figures, and references) through EDAS submission system, , but one additional page will be allowed with additional publication fee, An accepted paper must be registered before the registration deadline, An , accepted paper must be presented at the workshop, Failure to register before , the deadline will result in automatic withdrawal of the paper from the workshop , proceedings and the program, All accepted and presented papers will be included in the IEEE GLOBECOM , proceedings and IEEE digital library, GLOBECOM has the right to remove an , accepted and registered but not presented paper from the IEEE digital library., Extended version of selected accepted papers will be published in a special, issue of Journal of Communications (JCM)., Organization Committee:, =======================, Subir Das,         Telcordia Technologies, Inc, Jing Deng,         University of North Carolina at Greensboro , ...]</td>

      <td>COLING 2010\nCALL FOR PAPERS\n\n2nd Workshop on\nCollaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources\n\nBeijing\nAugust 28th, 2010\nhttp://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/scientific-community/coling-2010-workshop/\n\n\nKeywords:\nWikipedia, Wiktionary, Mechanical Turk, Games with a purpose,\nFolksonomies, Twitter, Social Networks\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe workshop builds upon the success of the first ACL "The People's Web\nmeets NLP" Workshop in 2009 that attracted 21 submissions. Accepted\nsubmissions included papers on Wikipedia [1], Wiktionary [2], Mechanical\nTurk [3], and game-based construction of semantic resources [4]. This\nclearly demonstrates a substantial and growing interest of the NLP\ncommunity in collaboratively constructed semantic resources (CSRs),\nalso evidenced by the increasing number of publications in this area\nand the EMNLP 2009 Web 2.0 track. In many works, CSRs have been used\nto overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck and coverage problems\npertinent to conventional lexical semantic resources. The greatest\npopularity in this respect can so far certainly be attributed to\nWikipedia [1]. However, other resources, such as folksonomies or the\nmultilingual collaboratively constructed dictionary Wiktionary, have\nalso shown great potential. Thus, the scope of the workshop deliberately\nincludes any collaboratively constructed resource, not only Wikipedia.\n\nEffective deployment of CSRs to enhance NLP introduces a pressing need\nto address a set of fundamental challenges, e.g. the interoperability\nwith existing resources, or the quality of the extracted lexical\nsemantic knowledge. Interoperability between resources is crucial as\nno single resource provides perfect coverage. The quality of CSRs is\na fundamental issue, as they lack editorial control and entries are\noften incomplete. Thus, techniques for link prediction [5] or\ninformation extraction [6] have been proposed to guide the "crowds"\nwhile constructing resources of better quality.\n\n[1] Olena Medelyan, David Milne, Catherine Legg and Ian H.

We will\nespecially welcome contributions of interdisciplinary nature, e.g. those\napplying discourse analysis techniques from computational linguistics to\nthe content of CSRs to better understand their properties.\n\nSpecific topics include but are not limited to:\n * Analysis of collaboratively constructed resources, such as wiki-based\n   platforms, folksonomies, Twitter, or social networks;\n * Using collaboratively constructed resources for NLP purposes such\n   as information retrieval, text categorization, information\n   extraction, etc.;\n * Using special features of collaboratively constructed resources to\n   create novel resource types, for example revision-based corpora,\n   simplified versions of resources, etc.;\n * Analyzing the structure of collaboratively constructed resources\n   related to their use in NLP;\n * Interoperability of collaboratively constructed resources with\n   conventional lexical semantic resources and between themselves;\n * Mining social and collaborative content for constructing structured\n   semantic resources and the corresponding tools;\n * Mining multilingual information from collaboratively constructed\n   resources;\n * Quality and reliability of collaboratively constructed semantic\n   resources. \n\nWe especially encourage short papers describing publicly available tools\nfor accessing or analyzing collaboratively constructed resources that can\nserve as a multiplier in the NLP community.\n\nThe workshop is intended to be highly interdisciplinary. Thus, we encourage\nthe participation of researchers working on computational linguistics\naspects (e.g. parsing or discourse analysis) or NLP applications (e.g.\ninformation retrieval, information extraction, question answering, and\nknowledge representation) as well as researchers from other areas who\nmight benefit from collaboratively constructed semantic resources.\n\nSubstantially extended versions of the best papers from the workshop can\nbe submitted to a planned Special Issue in one of the major computational\nlinguistics journals. The revised papers will have to undergo a separate\nreviewing process required for journal publications.\n\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n\nPaper submission deadline (full and short): May  30, 2010\nNotification

MT evaluations, such as those\nconducted by NIST, provide ample evidence that the field of MT continues\nto grow and attract more and more researchers.  Data-driven approaches\nhave become particularly fashionable in recent years.  These approaches\nhave generated systems that have been the top performers in recent\ncomparative evaluations.  Furthermore, the challenges of building\ncompetitive MT systems have been significantly reduced with the\nintroduction of open source toolkits such as GIZA++ and MOSES.  This\ndevelopment, exciting as it is, also bears the danger of introducing\nuniformity into MT research.  AMTA aims to promote diversity in MT\nresearch and actively seeks research papers across the entire range of the MT research spectrum for the AMTA-2010 research program.  We solicit\nsubmissions in English of unpublished papers describing original research\non all aspects of Machine Translation.

Most governmental entities are providing a benefit to\ntheir customers, who require them to translate large volumes of\ninformation and to make it available across multiple languages and varied\nnetwork architectures.  The need for language translation technology\nwithin governmental organizations is diverse and sometimes compartmented.\nGovernments are looking to advances in Machine Translation technology,\nwhich help them deliver information not only from the native languages of various countries but also into those other languages.  In\nturn, the information delivered helps the governments to understand social\nand political activities in context.  In an age when significant volumes\nof data are available in many languages, it is necessary to look to\nautomated alternatives, which assist the linguist and enable the human\ntranslation process.\n\nFor this year's AMTA conference, we are asking government participants to\nconsider topics that address the strategic challenges of applying MT tools\nand applications in their programs and processes.  We are looking for\nrepresentation from all government organizations that face language\nchallenges, including: Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human\nServices, Human Resources, Commerce, Labor, Energy, Judiciary, Business,\nTrade, Transportation, and many others.  Within the governmental\norganizations we request the attendance of leaders or their\nrepresentatives, who can address challenging topics ranging among:\n\n1.  Acquisition strategies that include policies directed towards      implementation of MT\n2.  Funding priorities that stress the need for metrics to ensure adequate     return on investment (ROI)\n3.  Requirements development which include a broad audience of users\n   across the federal workspace\n4.  Computer systems and network architectures that support inclusion of\n   MT tools and any significant integration and security challenges\n5.  Research and development leading to the advancement of tools that\n   support less commonly used languages or minimizes gaps\n6.  Program management strategies and how they apply to the integration\n   and acceptance of MT tool usage\n7.  Case studies on examples of MT use and how it impacts the\n   organizations ability to share content\n8.  Strategic views and objectives pertaining to challenges with respect\n   to MT programs and the employment of MT tools (e.g., IT, personnel,\n   implementation)\n9.  Implementation strategies that factor into MT use as a process\n   supporting human translation (pre-translation/post-editing)\n\nThe sessions will be structured to provide open and constructive dialogue\namong attendees with diverse technical backgrounds and areas of expertise. A secondary objective of this approach is to establish longer-term\nconnections among participants and foster new cooperative efforts.\n\n\nImportant dates:\n\n- Submissions due:                     Monday, June 28\n- Notification of acceptance:          Monday, July 12\n- Final "camera-ready" versions due:   Monday, August 16\n\n\nWhat to submit:\n\nIdeal proposals should include information on strategic views and\nobjectives pertaining to MT programs; employment of MT tools and\nsignificant challenges; as well as information on achievable gains through usage and/or metrics.  Submissions should be 250-400 word summaries and\nmay be sent directly in e-mail or as attachments in RTF format.\n\n\nHow to submit:\n\nSend submissions and questions to Government User program chairs, Nicholas Bemish at Nicholas.Bemish@dia.mil and Chuck Simmons at\nCharles.Simmons@wpafb.af.mil  by Monday, June 28.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStudent Research Workshop\n\nContact: Stephan Vogel ( stephan.vogel@cs.cmu.edu )\n\nAMTA-2010 will feature a Student Research Workshop, which will be embedded\nas an integral part of the research program at the conference.

We particularly encourage proposals on\ntopics related to the conference theme of MT applied within commercial\ntranslation settings.\n\nTutorials will be held on Sunday, October 31, immediately preceding the\nmain conference.  Workshops will be held on Thursday and Friday, November\n4-5, immediately following the main conference.  Selected panels will be\nan integral part of the main conference.\n\n\nAims:\n\nTutorials at AMTA conferences are a forum for experts in MT and MT-related areas to deliver concentrated training on a topic of interest in half-day\n(or occasionally full-day) teaching sessions.  Tutorials provide\nbackground that helps conference participants (especially newcomers to the field) understand the conference program, and/or enrich their\nunderstanding of particular technical, applied, and business matters\nsurrounding research, development and use of MT and translation\ntechnology.\n\nAMTA workshops are intended to provide the opportunity for MT-related\ncommunities of interest to spend focused time together advancing the state\nof thinking or the state of practice in their area of interest or\nendeavor.\n\nPanel sessions within the main conference program provide an opportunity\nfor a select number of experts to provide their perspective and hold a\ndiscussion on a concrete topic of interest or developing issue within the\nfield of MT.\n\nDue to AMTA 2010's collocation with the ATA meeting, we are particularly\ninterested in proposals related to commercialization of MT and/or its use\nby professional translators.  However, any themes connected to MT\nresearch, development, deployment, use, and evaluation are welcome.\n\n\nWhat to submit:\n\nProposals for workshops, tutorials and panel sessions should be submitted\nby June 30, 2010 to George Foster (george.foster@nrc.gc.ca).  They should\ninclude the proposed format (workshop, tutorial or panel), a title, a\none-page description of the proposed content, technical requirements and\nthe expected number of participants.  In the case of a workshop, the\nproposal should also include dates for important milestones (call for\npapers, recruitment of speakers, etc.), and whether this is an ongoing or\nnew workshop.  Workshop and Tutorial proposals must also include a signed\ncopy of the AMTA Workshop or Tutorial Policy and Leader Agreement Form.

We particularly encourage proposals on topics\nrelated to the conference theme of MT applied within commercial translation\nsettings.\n\nTutorials will be held on Sunday, October 31, immediately preceding the main \nconference.  Workshops will be held on Thursday and Friday, November 4-5,\nimmediately following the main conference.  Selected panels will be an\nintegral part of the main conference.\n\n\nAims:\n\nTutorials at AMTA conferences are a forum for experts in MT and MT-related\nareas to deliver concentrated training on a topic of interest in half-day (or\noccasionally full-day) teaching sessions.  Tutorials provide background that\nhelps conference participants (especially newcomers to the field) understand\nthe conference program, and/or enrich their understanding of particular\ntechnical, applied, and business matters surrounding research, development and\nuse of MT and translation technology.\n\nAMTA workshops are intended to provide the opportunity for MT-related\ncommunities of interest to spend focused time together advancing the state of\nthinking or the state of practice in their area of interest or endeavor. \n\nPanel sessions within the main conference program provide an opportunity for a\nselect number of experts to provide their perspective and hold a discussion on\na concrete topic of interest or developing issue within the field of MT.\n\nDue to AMTA 2010's collocation with the ATA meeting, we are particularly\ninterested in proposals related to commercialization of MT and/or its use by\nprofessional translators.  However, any themes connected to MT research,\ndevelopment, deployment, use, and evaluation are welcome.\n\n\nWhat to submit:\n\nProposals for workshops, tutorials and panel sessions should be submitted by\nJune 30, 2010 to George Foster (george.foster@nrc.gc.ca).  They should include\nthe proposed format (workshop, tutorial or panel), a title, a one-page\ndescription of the proposed content, technical requirements and the expected\nnumber of participants.  In the case of a workshop, the proposal should also\ninclude dates for important milestones (call for papers, recruitment of\nspeakers, etc.), and whether this is an ongoing or new workshop.  Workshop and\nTutorial proposals must also include a signed copy of the AMTA Workshop or\nTutorial Policy and Leader Agreement Form.  The appropriate forms will be\nposted on the conference web-page at:\n\nhttp://amta2010.amtaweb.org/\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCall for AMTA-2010 Sponsorships\n\nHelp support the AMTA Mission while demonstrating your leadership in the\nfuture of MT!\n\nSponsorship of AMTA-2010 is a tax-deductible donation.

The architectural foundation for SOC is provided by the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), which states that applications expose their functionality as services in a uniform and technology-independent way such that they can be discovered and invoked over the network. Claimed benefits of SOC include cheaper and faster development of business applications through repeated aggregation of services, better reuse of software artifacts and legacy applications through service wrappings, and easier adaptation to changes in the business environment through replacement and reconfiguration of services.\n\nIn order to realize these benefits routinely with SOC, for realistic business settings with complex IT environments, many challenges still need to be addressed. For example, supporting business processes and collaborations in an open service-oriented world requires a better understanding of integration problems along different dimensions. First of all, alignment between business demands and application functions has to be achieved. This requirement for vertical integration should drive the aggregation of services, from basic IT services to rich business services, to achieve the desired or given business processes. Secondly, horizontal integration has to be considered if business collaborations span multiple organizations. In such cases, interoperability between the services has to be ensured at different levels (syntactic, semantic and pragmatic) and on different aspects (information and behavior). Thirdly, we have to assume that business demands as well as IT capabilities will change over time. This evolution will impact existing solutions, and thus require the adaptation, management and maintenance (e.g., versioning, replacing, updating) of services and service compositions. Moreover, changes that occur at one level or on one aspect have to be propagated to other levels and aspects in order to keep the consistency of the integration solution. And finally, all of the above challenges not only exist at design-time, but at run-time as well. Service composition may be on-demand, driven by an end-user service creation activity, and running instances of composite services are subject to changes concerning, for instance, the availability of resources. This implies that service level agreements and associated quality-of-service need to be negotiated, monitored, and controlled in multi-party and heterogeneous environments.\n\nGOAL AND TOPICS\nThe goal of the workshop is to focus on the fundamental and practical challenges related to SOC, to discuss what theoretical, architectural or technology foundation is needed, and how this foundation can be supported or realized by new or enhanced infrastructures, standards and/or technologies. The workshop aims at contributing to the dissemination of research results, establishment of a better understanding, and identification of new challenges related to SOC/SOA, by bringing together interested academic and industrial researchers. \n\nTopics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:\n\nService foundation and design issues\n\t- principles of SOC/SOA, service science\n\t- service modelling approaches\n\t- formal specification and analysis\n\t- reasoning approaches\n\t- model-driven development, platform-independence\n\t- service interoperability (semantic, pragmatic), matching and (dynamic) composition\n\t- ontology-centered design\n\t- requirements-functionality (business-IT) alignment \n\t- Web 2.0, social networking, mash-ups\n\t- REST vs WS\n\t- repeated aggregation of services into composite applications and business processes\n\nService technology and infrastructure issues\n\t- architectural patterns\n\t- service registry management\n\t- requirements management, service evolution\n\t- quality-of-service management\n\t- cross-domain service delivery\n\t- specific technology platform solutions\n\t- language-specific solutions\n\t- tool support\n\t- applicability and performance experiences\n\t- service level agreements\n\nService usage issues and applications of SOC/SOA\n\t- service registration, update, de-registration\n\t- service discovery, matching, selection, replacement\n\t- service invocation, interaction, monitoring\n\t- service choreography, mediation, orchestration\n\t- traceability of technology changes in requirements and vice versa\n\t- mobile and ubiquitous applications\n\t- health and homecare applications\n\t- supply chain management applications\n\t- e-commerce applications\n\t- experiences regarding SOC in industrial and real-world applications\n\nPUBLICATION\nAll accepted papers will be published in a workshop proceedings book, under an ISBN reference, and in CD-ROM support.

      <td>CALL FOR PAPERS\n\nLREC 2010 Workshop on Web Logs and Question Answering\n\nValletta, Malta, Saturday 22nd May 2010\n\nwww.csis.ul.ie/wlqa2010\n\nSubmission deadline: 12th February 2010\n\nMotivation &amp; Scope\n==================\n\nAn Information Retrieval system takes a user query and returns a ranked list\nof documents. On the other hand, a Question Answering system provides an\nexact answer [1]. There has been quite a long period of research in factoid\nQA driven by annual tracks at CLEF [2], TREC [3] and NTCIR [4]. The result\nof this work has been that it is possible to construct systems which can\nanswer simple factoid queries with high accuracy. This has led to the belief\nthat QA is a "solved problem" where no more research is required. However,\nthe questions are not usually from real users, they are devised by the\nassessors at CLEF, TREC etc. Secondly, they are restricted to certain\nwell-known simple types which are only a small subset of the real questions\nwhich people wish to ask. Thirdly, questions are considered in isolation (or\nin some tracks a fixed group) and not in a dialogue context whereas in our\ninteractions with people all questions are answered in context and with the\npossibility for clarification. Thus, there is a need to inject new ideas\ninto QA research.\n\nRecently there has been much interest in Web query logs and in particular\nmethods for analysing these in order to extract information which can be\nused to improve IR systems [5,6]. Logs are typically extremely large and\ncontain naturally occurring and noisy data. Automatic techniques (using for\nexample statistical approaches or machine learning algorithms) are therefore\nnecessary since manual approaches are not generally feasible.\n\nThe purpose of the workshop, therefore, is to investigate how some of the\nmethods developed for analysing web logs within an implicit IR context can\nbe applied to QA. For example:\n\n* Can the meaning of IR queries in logs be deduced automatically in order to\nextract the corresponding questions from them?\n\n* Can NLP techniques developed within QA, e.g. Named Entity recognition be\napplied to the analysis of query logs?\n\n* Can logs be used to deduce useful new forms of question (i.e. not simple\nfactoids) which could be looked at next by QA researchers?\n\n* Can questions grouped into sessions be comprehended in such a way as to\ndeduce the underlying implicit natural language dialogue consisting of a\ncoherent sequence of questions where each follows logically from both the\nprevious ones and the system's responses to them?\n\n* Are there logs from real (or experimental) QA systems like lexxe.com which\ncan be obtained and what can be learned from them from the perspective of\ndesigning evaluation tasks? What about logs from sites like answers.com\n(where queries are answered by human respondents)?\n\n* Are QA query logs different from IR query logs? Do users behave\ndifferently in QA systems? Can QA-style questions be identified within an IR\nlog?\n\n* Can click-through data - where the aim of a question can be inferred from\nthe returned documents which are inspected - be used for the development of\nQA systems for example for the deduction of important query types and their\nlinks to IR queries?\n\n* Are there logs of transcribed speech made from telephone QA systems which\ncan be obtained and what analysis could be carried out on those, using for\nexample techniques developed at related tracks at CLEF such as\nCross-Language Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) and Question Answering on Script\nTranscription (QAST)?\n\nHistorically, QA was a combination of NLP and IR. Much web log analysis is a\nform of IR in which the same problem of retrieval is being approached from a\ndifferent direction, namely the queries themselves.

What about logs from sites like answers.com, (where queries are answered by human respondents)?, * Are QA query logs different from IR query logs? Do users behave, differently in QA systems? Can QA-style questions be identified within an IR, log?, * Can click-through data - where the aim of a question can be inferred from, the returned documents which are inspected - be used for the development of, QA systems for example for the deduction of important query types and their, links to IR queries?, * Are there logs of transcribed speech made from telephone QA systems which, can be obtained and what analysis could be carried out on those, using for, example techniques developed at related tracks at CLEF such as, Cross-Language Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) and Question Answering on Script, Transcription (QAST)?, Historically, QA was a combination of NLP and IR, Much web log analysis is a, form of IR in which the same problem of retrieval is being approached from a, different direction, namely the queries themselves, Thus we are proposing, here a new combination, namely QA and log analysis, These fields are, complementary and share the goal of building better systems for users., 1, Prager, J, (2006), Open-Domain Question Answering (2006), Foundations and,    Trends in Information Retrieval, 1 (2), 1-141., 2, CLEF (2009), http://www.clef-campaign.org, Accessed 2009., 3, TREC (2009), http://trec.nist.gov/, Accessed 2009., 4, NTCIR (2009), http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/, Accessed 2009., 5, Jansen, J., Taksa, I., &amp; Spink, A, (eds.)

Soft computing is one of the most relevant answers to such needs: neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic/evolutionary algorithms are fundamental keys to tackle these difficult problems.  On the other hand, accuracy and uncertainty issues as well as suited data acquisition systems must be carefully considered in these applications since the quality of the solution greatly relies on them.  Up to now, analysis and experiments have been performed by scientists and practitioners mainly to understand the underlying technologies and methodologies, but without any specific focus on the mandatory need of a quantitative assessment and a metrological analysis.  Measurement science and technologies are in fact vital to ensure the correct and effective use of soft computing technologies in real environments.  CIMSA 2010 will continue the exciting experience of the previous editions by filling this gap in knowledge and practice, by focusing on the quantitative aspect of measurement issues for industrial, environmental, and engineering applications.\n\nPapers are solicited on all aspects of computational intelligence technologies for measurement systems and the related applications, from the points of view of both theory and practice.  This includes but is not limited to: intelligent measurement systems; accuracy and precision of neural and fuzzy components; intelligent sensor fusion; intelligent monitoring and control systems; neural and fuzzy technologies for identification, prediction, and control of complex dynamic systems; evolutionary monitoring and control; neural and fuzzy signal/image processing for industrial and environmental applications; image understanding and recognition; soft-computing technologies for robotics and vision; soft computing technologies for medical and bioengineering applications; hybrid systems; fuzzy and neural components for embedded systems; hardware implementation of neural and fuzzy systems for measurements; neural, fuzzy and genetic/evolutionary algorithms for system optimization and calibration; neural and fuzzy diagnosis of components and systems; reliability of fuzzy and neural components; fault tolerance and testing in fuzzy and neural components; neural and fuzzy techniques for quality measurement.\n\nSUBMIT EXTENDED ABSTRACTS OR DRAFT PAPERS BY 15 APRIL 2010\nDetails for the submission and all information concerning the symposium can be found at the symposium here.

Scientific approaches and practical techniques come from linguistics, computer science, psychology, and mathematics. Nowadays, there is a number of practical applications available. These applications are sometimes developed by smart yet NLP-untrained developers who solve the problems using sophisticated heuristics.\r\n\r\nComputational Linguistics needs to be applied to make the full use of the Internet. There is a definite need for software that can handle unstructured text to allow search for information on the web. According to the European Commission, Human Language Technologies are one of the key research areas for the upcoming years. The priority aim of the research in this area is to enable users to communicate with the computer in their native language.\r\n\r\nCLA'10 Workshop is a place where the parties meet to exchange views and ideas with a benefit to all involved. The Workshop will focus on practical outcome of modeling human language use and the applications needed to improve human-machine interaction.\r\nPaper Topics\r\n\r\nThis call is for papers that present research and developments on all aspects of Natural Language Processing used in real-life applications, such as (this list is not exhaustive):\r\n\r\n    * information retrieval\r\n    * extraction of linguistic knowledge from text corpora\r\n    * semantic ontologies in computer linguistics\r\n    * lexical resources\r\n    * machine translation and translation aids\r\n    * ambiguity resolution\r\n    * text classification\r\n    * corpus-based language modeling\r\n    * POS-tagging\r\n    * parsing issues\r\n    * proofing tools\r\n    * dialogue systems\r\n    * machine learning methods applied to language processing\r\n    * ontology and taxonomy evaluation\r\n    * opinion mining\r\n    * question answering\r\n    * sentiment analysis\r\n    * speech and audio processing\r\n    * text summarization\r\n    * use of NLP techniques in practical applications\r\n\r\n \r\nPaper Presentation\r\n\r\nThe presentation of the paper has to include a demonstration of an existing tool. The papers should include a section describing the tool (or a prototype), which demonstrates the theory discussed in the paper.\r\n\r\nThe presentation is divided into two parts. First, the author(s) shortly demonstrate their tools to the audience. In the second part, the authors discuss their work with other participants and let the audience test their software.\r\n\r\nPapers will be evaluated and accepted on the basis of their technical merit, usefulness of the real life application and relevance to the workshop scope by the CLA'10 Program Committee. The paper will be assessed by academics as well as industry representatives in order to assure fair and balanced assessment.\r\n\r\nAll accepted and presented papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings and included in the IEEE XploreÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ® database. The best demonstrations will be selected to be shown to the general audience of the conference at a plenary session.\r\nPapers Submission\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    * Authors should submit draft papers (as Postscript, PDF of MSWord file).\r\n    * The total length of a paper should not exceed 8 pages (IEEE style). IEEE style templates will be available ASAP.\r\n    * Papers will be refereed and accepted on the basis of their scientific merit and relevance to the workshop.\r\n    * Accepted and Presented paper will be published in the Conference Proceedings and included in the IEEE XploreÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ® database.\r\n    * Organizers reserve right to move accepted papers between IMCSIT events.\r\n\r\n \r\nImportant dates\r\n\r\n31.05.2010 (May 31, 2010) - Full paper submission\r\n12.07.2010 (July 12, 2010) - Notification of acceptance\r\n23.08.2010 (August 23, 2010) - Camera-ready version of the accepted paper\r\nCLA '09 post conference report\r\n\r\nIt seems that the motto of our workshop "Show the system in action" has been accepted by the NLP community. This year 33 papers were submitted (90% increase from last year); 19 of them were accepted by the programming committee. 15 papers were presented during the workshop - our guests from Iran or Tunisia seemingly found Poland too far away from their homelands. Still, 11 countries were represented in the workshop, mainly from the Western Europe.\r\n\r\nThe workshop was composed of oral presentations and the demo-poster session. Presentations, given on Tuesday (October, 12th), were divided into three sessions:\r\n\r\n   1. Information Retrieval,\r\n   2. Use of NLP Tools In practical application,\r\n   3. Parsing issues; Linguistic resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening the audience voted for the best presentations of each of the session as well as the best overall performance. The voters used their mobile phones and the result were known immediately - to the chairman. The winners were presented officially at the Gala Ceremony (In the Oscar Ceremony fashion). The Information Retrieval session was one by Igor Leturia from Spain - or rather his virtual agent who could fluently answer any question posed in the Basque language. The session on Practical Applications was won by Eric Wehrli from Switzerland and his micro-scanner that read German texts and translated them into English. Parsing issues were best presented by charming Katarzyna Moroz from Poznan (Poland) who convinced the audience that her new parsing algorithm using pregroup grammars will soon outperform existing ones. And finally, after the three nominees had been presented, the Oscar went to...Spain.\r\n\r\nThe demo-poster session took place on Wednesday morning. It looked as if the participants had not celebrated too long into the Tuesday night - at 9 a.m. almost all of them were ready to put their applications under the pressure of real tests. Well, the winner did not understand the chairman's Basque too well... she obviously preferred her master, Igor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLA - where sciencemeets reality !</td>

Those accepted will be\r\npresented either orally or as posters. The decision about the\r\npresentation format will be based on the recommendation of the\r\nreviewers. The authors are asked to submit their papers using the\r\non-line form accessible from the conference website.\r\n\r\nPapers submitted to TSD 2008 must not be under review by any other\r\nconference or publication during the TSD review cycle, and must not be\r\npreviously published or accepted for publication elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'\r\nnames and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the\r\nauthor's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...",\r\nshould be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously\r\nshowed (Smith, 1991) ...".  Papers that do not conform to the\r\nrequirements above are subject to be rejected without review.\r\n\r\nThe authors are strongly encouraged to write their papers in TeX\r\nor LaTeX formats. These formats are necessary for the final\r\nversions of the papers that will be published in the Springer\r\nLecture Notes.  Authors using a WORD compatible software for the\r\nfinal version must use the LNCS template for WORD and within the\r\nsubmit process ask the Proceedings Editors to convert the paper\r\nto LaTeX format.  For this service a service-and-license fee of\r\nCZK 1500 will be levied automatically.\r\n\r\nThe paper format for review has to be either PDF or PostScript file\r\nwith all required fonts included. Upon notification of acceptance,\r\npresenters will receive further information on submitting their\r\ncamera-ready and electronic sources (for detailed instructions on\r\nthe final paper format see\r\nhttp://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html#Proceedings.)\r\n\r\nAuthors are also invited to present actual projects, developed\r\nsoftware or interesting material relevant to the topics of the\r\nconference.  The presenters of the demonstration should provide the\r\nabstract not exceeding one page. The demonstration abstracts will not\r\nappear in the conference proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT DATES\r\n\r\nMarch 13 2010 ............ Submission of abstract\r\nMarch 20 2010 ............

Ontology engineering\r\nmethodologies and tools have been proposed to ease the designing and\r\npopulating of ontological knowledge bases. Reasoning engines have been\r\nimplemented to exploit inference capabilities of ontologies, and\r\nsemantic-based frameworks have been built to enrich the functionalities of\r\nWeb services. These achievements are the pillars to deal with the complex\r\nchallenge of bringing semantics to the Web.\r\n\r\nThe above gives a new ground to extend the focus of the Semantic Web by\r\nengaging it in other communities, where semantics can play an important\r\nrole. The available semantic knowledge bases can be used to enrich and link\r\nadditional repositories, ontology engineering techniques can be utilized to\r\nproperly design and build ontologies in further real-world domains, and\r\ninference and query mechanisms can enhance classic information management\r\nand retrieval approaches.\r\n\r\nAmong these communities, this workshop aims to attract the attention of\r\nstudents and professionals both from academia and industry who take benefit\r\nof semantic-based techniques and technologies in within-application\r\nAdaptation, Personalization and Recommendation approaches. In parallel to\r\nthe progress made in the Semantic Web research topics, there have been\r\nappearing works in the above areas that use ontologies to model the userÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s\r\npreferences, tastes and interests, and exploit these personal features\r\ntogether with meta-information about multimedia contents in order to provide\r\nthe user with adaptation and personalization capabilities for different\r\npurposes such as information retrieval and item recommendation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, with the advent of the Web 2.0 (also called the Social Web), the\r\npotential study and development of those approaches have increased\r\nexponentially. Social networks allow people to provide explicit\r\nrelationships with others, and find out implicit user similarities based on\r\ntheir profiles. Social tagging services offer the opportunity to easily\r\ncreate and exploit personal knowledge representations. Wiki-style sites\r\nrepresent an environment where the community contributes and shares\r\ninformation, and blogs are media in which users express subjective opinions.\r\nIn all of these scenarios, adaptation, personalization and recommendation\r\nare core functionalities. However, the understanding and exploitation of the\r\nsemantics underlying user and item profiles are still open issues.\r\n\r\n++++++++++++++++++\r\nTopics of interest\r\n++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nThe workshop will focus on establishing user/usage models for adaptation,\r\npersonalization and recommendation approaches for the Social-semantic Web.\r\n\r\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to the exploitation of the\r\nWeb of Data, the identification of semantics underlying social annotations\r\nof multimedia contents, and the application of semantic-based techniques and\r\ntechnologies in research fields related to:\r\n\r\n   * Personalized access to multimedia content\r\n   * Content-based recommendation and collaborative filtering\r\n   * Adaptive exploration of multimedia content\r\n   * Adaptive user interfaces for multimedia content browsing and searching\r\n   * Community extraction and exploitation\r\n   * Social networks analysis for collaborative recommendation\r\n   * User profile construction based on social tagging information\r\n   * Context-aware multimedia content access and delivery\r\n   * Mobile and ubiquitous multimedia content access and delivery\r\n\r\n++++++++++++++++++++\r\nOrganizing Committee\r\n++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\n   * IvÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡n Cantador, Universidad AutÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ³noma de Madrid, Spain\r\n   * Peter Mika, Yahoo!

++++++++++, Motivation, ++++++++++, During the last years, researchers and practitioners of the Semantic Web, have progressively consolidated a number of very important achievements., Formal languages have been standardized to define ontology-based knowledge, representations, logic formalisms and query models, Ontology engineering, methodologies and tools have been proposed to ease the designing and, populating of ontological knowledge bases, Reasoning engines have been, implemented to exploit inference capabilities of ontologies, and, semantic-based frameworks have been built to enrich the functionalities of, Web services, These achievements are the pillars to deal with the complex, challenge of bringing semantics to the Web., The above gives a new ground to extend the focus of the Semantic Web by, engaging it in other communities, where semantics can play an important, role, The available semantic knowledge bases can be used to enrich and link, additional repositories, ontology engineering techniques can be utilized to, properly design and build ontologies in further real-world domains, and, inference and query mechanisms can enhance classic information management, and retrieval approaches., Among these communities, this workshop aims to attract the attention of, students and professionals both from academia and industry who take benefit, of semantic-based techniques and technologies in within-application, Adaptation, Personalization and Recommendation approaches, In parallel to, the progress made in the Semantic Web research topics, there have been, appearing works in the above areas that use ontologies to model the userÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s, preferences, tastes and interests, and exploit these personal features, together with meta-information about multimedia contents in order to provide, the user with adaptation and personalization capabilities for different, purposes such as information retrieval and item recommendation., Moreover, with the advent of the Web 2.0 (also called the Social Web), the, potential study and development of those approaches have increased, exponentially, Social networks allow people to provide explicit, relationships with others, and find out implicit user similarities based on, their profiles, Social tagging services offer the opportunity to easily, create and exploit personal knowledge representations, Wiki-style sites, represent an environment where the community contributes and shares, information, and blogs are media in which users express subjective opinions., In all of these scenarios, adaptation, personalization and recommendation, are core functionalities, However, the understanding and exploitation of the, semantics underlying user and item profiles are still open issues., ++++++++++++++++++, Topics of interest, ++++++++++++++++++, The workshop will focus on establishing user/usage models for adaptation,, personalization and recommendation approaches for the Social-semantic Web., Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the exploitation of the, Web of Data, the identification of semantics underlying social annotations, of multimedia contents, and the application of semantic-based techniques and, technologies in research fields related to:,    * Personalized access to multimedia content,    * Content-based recommendation and collaborative filtering,    * Adaptive exploration of multimedia content,    * Adaptive user interfaces for multimedia content browsing and searching,    * Community extraction and exploitation,    * Social networks analysis for collaborative recommendation,    * User profile construction based on social tagging information,    * Context-aware multimedia content access and delivery,    * Mobile and ubiquitous multimedia content access and delivery, ++++++++++++++++++++, Organizing Committee,
